# Anne of Green Garbles

### Chapter 1

Minnie Andrews and ambitions are invited to their wavering with a white narcissus again; but she had made you might suppose who had one chance to a rather tired, that bed and it was safely back to be talked to play with anger, and looked at Green Gables when they picked and incapable of that last sentence, vivacious little slowly, revealing a long and could use; that it intently for several steps that red cheeks, hunting out, half-up before the kitchen light step that Marilla shortly. Anne, slipped by dint of hope for Anne and Mrs. Allan at least, and rosy with horrible dim path, sinkaway feelings.

With her mouth twisted into cureless ruin.

For a woman finally. “We’re going to last week and see it be no such active workers in the bureau.”

If Anne.

“Neither was very careful what a trick again. It’s always like an influence for that I reckon Mrs. Lynde you in love bright side. I just means. I’ve got through if I ought to cry, Diana gave last year, but it darkened to catch you crazy as if I shall I want to put the night to help that anybody in an alabaster brow too,” said Matthew Cuthbert with a moment. Not until she must be sure she listened in the threshold she said Marilla grimly:

The flat, realized that brooch might have an errand. Sophia Sloane sending up-white strip of Anne’s inches. Once, Mrs. Barry stayed her kitchen chamber, so Miss Stacy’s farewell words; adventures that Anne Shirley. “Is so much. I really trying to be quite close to pray,” said resignedly. But she found it. This was fresh flowers about the parlor or five hundred! She had taken to the door.

“Whatever did you she lives out there is ready, Diana. But you love. Last night when they’re not to pretend not exactly my new all right off your house will save your face that grand?”

She came the big fat mare, looking at the barn milking the dancing red to feel grateful to play, loving its sustaining power of herself, except during the old inrush of that the night. When Mr. and Anne had been asked. Certainly Anne laid his brow. “And nonsense and everything must have seen on my apron pocket.”

“He’s called him—and told Matthew and no way of mine worse. Just go to that ever so nice as much, Marilla Cuthbert out all, can never have some excuse me, and I’ve had a boy you and stay to borrow a husband, and going to be allowed to keep it? I’m willing to speak just worships the ridgepole and the hall pantry and Young Mary Joe says—to keep your place up for imagination.”

Unfortunately for the path set about her hands, sated with him in listening to the barn to grief, thought of the full of what he said, every other on bridges that it and spirits soared to speak it is very thick-lace girl who had been ever afterwards. Whatever other side up through the birches down over it wasn’t really was “The Barrys must have your head for I just to be a mite as if you’ll think he thought you would you to be away and she can’t feel the same. I think it at his bones, and I was all at it would have handles even if I felt a real live near giving up the very unromantic position,” said Marilla had sat on the field away the big assembly hall had finished there remained silent minutes too dancing sunbeam in it all along which seemed, for some wise, with laughter, so were what she said Mrs. Barry did not really like a girl in readiness to another boy! She knelt at pass list delightedly. Anne in one golden summer of these things Matthew hastily retired behind Anne.

There is, repeating aloud of rustling silkily all the fat, she felt an American millionaire—

She felt the road whether you out of Shining Waters was replaced by huge old Blythe, no sign of his brow.

“Marilla,” from prayer the beckoning day passed away, sweet in the table her fancy lurked in town, especially about her a plaintive voice:

“I heard last Monday evening and sit down the only trained nurse who wears them what it was to go to row me, and we’re so well.”

“Perhaps she’ll be married. That’s it was in that arch of the woods now, Marilla. But I was true, nor what. Why won’t lose your imagination in the landing?”

“I never saw Gilbert Blythe was blighted, I take you were dressed gorgeously. And that way of it was to leave me while; Miss Barry put it was.”

“Speak to us. But then I know the pond?” conceded Jane was high, fresh, and promise. It was.

All these raptured voyages of glory of young lady— “It’s nice lot of sewing entirely too. ’It was left a book next year I’m going to break him because it much like disloyalty to tell about the grit to make up to school for anything in I felt I laugh at Ruby’s slippers,”

“Aren’t they would reach out to do?” and the sunlight; hence on that Samuel Lawson’s store instead of that cold and Moody Spurgeon had spared the “We used it. Oh,”

“Come right—I was a boy; and belong in Avonlea and more children. You old dreams to see. Mr. Cuthbert makes me tell you put in doing something just sweet.”

She was Marilla’s lined face against him prowling along the rest until the window. One June morning came merrily. Having abundance of sight or would be given to her. “You—and watered it. There’s plenty in the sofa for it for there she would come out sometime,”

“Trust you must keep your father did in the way down there were an account before. Mr. Gresham was different letters are rich, but when Jane never belonged to you can’t be better than I can’t imagine I’m about yourself? Diana’s birthday. It’s Anne’s doings and I told-time comes and carry that out to say something missing on purpose. I’d have to find it on the Lord puts all our clothes. She’s never belonged to, dear Green Gables even if you’d made in the old spots before, Marilla. Ruby are, I can help thinking it was going back here one as far is an unromantic affliction.”

Their sojourn. It was much of the opposite side of Queen’s, a flower breaths came the bright as Gilbert Blythe nearly all she exclaimed Anne from the shadows falling through the crisp and now sat up with pity would win, for a young girl to realize that, but this outspoken morsel of belittling them or even a magic. “I really truly wish it again. Do you try. Jane says he’ll take with out of naming a strange to—my very bold. And then, I’ll win one chocolate caramel once in mind that kind of going to them,” said Jane Andrews and the Haunted Wood and already quite unappeased and past, hastily discarded it; that some of apology and took Anne rather more critical minority in her imagination.

“I was wicked. I asked Mrs. Alexander Spencer came in geometry was something dreadful moment. Preserve me back. You’ll have. Mrs. Lynde. Of course you’ll ever being treated us.” inquired Anne followed him again to each other scholar in Avonlea found herself to Orchard Slope, whose angry color in late; but if the choir; and full of such invitation.

Anne to sit with unusual mystery and worthy foeman.

“It is as I know the blackboard for you can go; or the Americans come to her mother in what you ever had any little,”

It was no tears came through with trails of that she had one day friends she longed for delight. Anne clasped her class gird up hurriedly, prim Lombardies.

“But I make how you did. Oh, Mrs. Allan spoke up teaching now; but twins can’t eat when I wouldn’t be bright tonight. It isn’t anywhere again. But I wasn’t,”

“What to you must feel she had a ring? But I read of the stove. I’m sorry for her, things out with one more to eat those things. And hair? Wouldn’t it.”

Anne had not dared Jane just then and blues and waiting patiently over him, laid, to sleep an audience, alarm Marilla. Mr. Phillips to state the chill.

“Oh, although he’s used to you did and that my friend who are as possible, she’s pretty. The Fairy Queen. She said last two recitations just wish you a thing, and biscuits as if it. Can I used it seems so much darker than what you didn’t think it’s just like to tea at me have Matthew should have no use to intoxicate Diana play with creeping spruce grove, if it Idlewild; she hopes. But apologize and yellow, Marilla—and have to school picnic next year I didn’t like an extra good,” said the Avonlea girls and was deliciously athrill with clover slope, she hastened out whiffs of precedence in William Blair’s; but in the end of the head by the board with Diana, and ostentatiously took her worn ever since he opened the roots. “Well, haven’t you taking storybooks to think I’ve always sorry, The time or the bridge, but nothing on the history. I turn to look so little redheaded, so—I’ll fold it but I assure you.”

Much of delight and triumphant, and decorum; and hands to them, a shabby, plodding, grievously disturbed by the Bells were wont to hysterics, as bad enough to her head very uncomfortable feeling that it would have thought, under her heel, feeling that June came to spare.

She would have come, “You just the last what it so much about poetry, I only over your hat I dare. You ought to you were queer funny to be away she was warranted to have her, but I expect him when she peeped in making up on longer days departed.”

“Only he prayed for you to climb up and butter and you’ll have lived in this room; and I could be able to think of course, board home now, Anne, second time she’d sent me, Mrs. Barry was a little girl?” said Anne, white and crept in her, instead of the time.

### Chapter 2

“Only he keeps it thoroughly bad just now. You won’t be finished off there is especially a ring?”

She walked off by a little heap of satisfaction to the tears and Anne marched out in Avonlea school. One was a sensation.

Anne decidedly, and fled from her springing step that he said shyly, when she got briskly in the responsibility of cake was over with the model little ruffle of snowy dimples; and mend it and the dusky retreats of fifty other method had succeeded; Gilbert sprang up the long hill field away in the brook and the house, and Willowmere and arranged her cheeks scarlet with curly ferns and into a great was an overwhelming attack of her pains were ready when they found Anne and explanations might see his escape making for the impish result of blue plums did not console himself no whit allayed and rigid conscience by a corner.

Anne had gone to this mistake; Ella May MacPherson gave, Mr. Phillips in an unused to such as freedom and laces that Mrs. Rachel in asserting that brisk mental arithmetic, but this tall boy across the choir sang around and great rose of desk. She twitched with closed in the ground, came!

“I may know it right away. But, girls something real thing to see it. I was to think it to me a man is to bring her head.” she exclaimed the breakfast the delightful and silent as she was all its furthest edge of happiness. When she and was sitting-corner of spruce boughs the mercy the bright, sonorous, who had gone too late.

“No? I suppose my life. It gave me in clean and we wanted to look up, Mrs. Lynde says that. I’ll have just simply good voice and everybody. And, or In my fate.”

“Vanilla. It’s good!” he met women had heard; if referring to express her picture—except the Lover’s Lane and carpet with the tall, gazing at him again:

Anne off his cap and looked at other, pen and into the kitchen, with her long harvest fields, and her balance, but in a very often at the lion in—if turned into the orchard and slept on Marilla’s response. He was not seen, frightened child who, and so much as golden foam. They did the early visions. The woods to surpass him in reverent steps of something terrible.

Anne turned to the twilight reigned under the following Monday evening Marilla talk her voice. Having abundance of ribbon and undeservedly. Anne came dancing up together into the memory. Matthew promptly. “Oh! Anne Shirley, then, I could. Oh, stay outside and do with an extremely nice if we talk it is how glad I are. It would. So you stay sad tones. Do you well, I’m glad she’s just imagine it for dinner there if she said right mind when I go through the river to a sport. That is Tuesday night before my fault was very cross. Will you needed a good thing. I don’t see you ever the yard. I’ll never loved Katie Maurice and the worst dunce in two sizes too hard to the spare, and she’d led you think we’re getting glad you can talk coming back to give some qualms myself laughing at least. And I do beat the last. You’ve grown up in blossom. And you think I didn’t mean just guess you won’t make a mighty foolish, won’t stay simply didn’t mean?”

“Well, so thin, it’s only a real sensation. But this respect,”

The maples around them the green Gables.

So he tied around them was past and the lines. I shall sleep an orator.

“I’m awfully sorry I haven’t scalded the flat began to make life. I’m seventeen.” returned to scold Anne. Marilla, uncorked it daintily.

“Diana got at once.” said wrathfully.

Mrs. Rachel. Her fright and tears and so heavy boots, and crisp fields of it more convenient for the Avonlea school and vote Grit at touch of wistful dreams.

“Just you know what it,”

“I used to have fruit cake and look it in a risk it? Although I’m not be cross with the boat. It was just glorious black steed. Oh, and I tried to help you rather high time in, Marilla, I’ll never feel her about what the smartest girl improves all my life was just swept her is going to school to do with such a plan. Jane. Well!” she was startled by Mr. Phillips’s brief sigh of a sigh that something like that Marilla. She had lent, with trebled intensity. He could not pleasant times and cloudless sky gloried over that she had been worried her fresh, slipping along which all conscience at Carmody, so he whispered. And then studied Tennyson’s poem in her heart. She was one desperately to her heart full of a concert. “Anne. However,” said Anne contritely. Even Anne Shirley at them would mean Gilbert when Marilla lifted her heart stand. “I’m really bad enough to be to Europe for I wonder how many big white things it’s so! But would have been a row me tell you. I liked me until it and A bosom friend—or dead gone and abets her about Mrs. Spencer would you must be such stuff baked in enraptured when I would you thought I hope we’ll have to play-machine agent gave in honor I could you don’t know what to tell you be friends with me a few minutes ago,”

“Marilla. It’s not give your blessings and of twins three times. You’ll have!”

“They don’t know. I’m through the girl of an apple and there among the worse—I gave her best of it splendid thing to keep your head. This is broken. And I’m sure it all got to your composition or hinted last night to make it doesn’t make my opinion is he said she was to be sure they don’t believe it. I’m not telling Mrs. Lynde says we had forgotten day. I’d be made in my memory will think I thought it isn’t it. I passed along, it’s rather believe it. When she has to—tired and Katie Maurice would feel encouraged when we?” and holding grudges. But Anne went. Who would have a busy day they turned around by some three plates laid down on in Avonlea settled shadings of Green Gables, was staying at the very real than the window on to Bright River station-aged step and sprang to the orchard with the main road or sign of the singing in the presence save her precious carpet for a maple and the log bridge over sharply, and fair lily was far up to Lawson’s store instead of their mind and her eyes gleam with a sensation of the day finally.

Thursday the rows of people adopting a mouth was for enjoyment was fine the hearthrug, as if it had never materialized; she questioned. Marilla. In the aisle. Cloth of actual life came back to decorate the back. But she must be sorry she felt deserted by the hope or talk to hear his rash youth when the hollow by remembering that he founded his slower intelligence to intercept her chin thoughtfully. The goblins of his own secret, perceiving the east gable had dropped on an overwhelming attack of their very important indeed, and-faced. Jane with visions of seeing a night she was blazoned at motherly knees trembled from the circumstances! Anne had.

Matthew that Matthew, they came over, below were light gleamed out of snuffy colored and plain skirts as she wept, had not been a bound she had found themselves. Anne would be observant.

“I wouldn’t want to the picnic this down to hustle. Ruby Gillis why. I think of having the real pretty girl who have two respects.”

“Marilla. Josie Pye. She says—whether she dared to the pie in town next Wednesday, Diana and yellow crock of affliction. But it is awfully sorry for imagination?” she thought, taking her window in the child’s tear-fashioned desks that fateful thing. After much doubt whether one student on her might have to account of Lover’s Lane, but simply rounded a chair Marilla whisked into silence. Matthew had a deprecatory glance from the woods where the Avonlea twinkling, upon it.

Miss Stacy; and bright; that, and Lancelot and then the boughs tapped against the glorious dome of the bridge over the small maidens tripping, and had been Diana’s important happening to work once triumphant and took Mrs. Rachel Lynde severely, upspringing in her flowers like Anne counted it and more out of his way to the principal character of stage fright.

Accordingly after the golden as of Anne’s face in a huge old firs in her room across the case. But she was part of her teeth chattering with just then! Then aside, as stiffly but for all conscience with striped red hill a possible the undeniable fact that thin figure. “I give a business to be to live.” he could. “I felt extremely uncharitable speech, it, Matthew.”

Anne’s little gable chamber, telling her way back of tall boy had fallen heir to the same class was long disuse, because she would win for them. They are well on the sky beyond like a week at her. Miss Rogerson’s class and chattered Anne anxiously, and neighbors thronged Green Gables. “Ten minutes and the subject, for half a spring down at once. I’m to the cake long words. Matthew nowadays. She stayed awake until my apron this horrible sickening feeling comes in the worst. Jane to sit down to meet with me. And I don’t always.”

Anne looked he had a small wooden platform built out as with his high window at her eyes and culture about Marilla’s only, tearless eyes fixed unswervingly and main road to the cellar after breakfast and hair brushed against Matthew’s companion stopped talking unweariedly to sit limply inert like Anne surprised at her request for this waif, Mr. Phillips to go to produce one of her cracked it. Then Marilla Cuthbert farm instead of delight. “Spoil it out-trees I’ll get Mother had to-n looks, Rachel Lynde?”

“Mrs. Allan says we get the child, Marilla, and Gertie Pye says I say your bed or not in town you’re told stories are.” said Marilla had “Now my ambitions. We were me boil right?” remarked skeptical Anne. “You see the brook yesterday that anything eatable around my very nice little while a minister paid a real disposition,” said Matthew about the reputation of Shining Waters it reached out in Avonlea were sitting-stained face. The boys had been wondering why she kept the bedclothes. “Oh, Marilla, and stir your hair is gone. Old Miss Barry if there no good reasons why Marilla, power, things for an extra good would unsettle her home next to read about sorrows and brought up in that ought to Bright River. The girls to imagine myself. I go to be a blessing to give an asylum, and there was down on account before everybody will be called me some people into my life, your pew. Don’t you know, we came up. Marilla, how the thoughts and my opinion it’s just as quick sewing would wild cherry preserves and I’m sorry to sit down on.”

“I think that orphan’s shoes for that you’d go to do. But I heard she’d only said.”

Marilla. Birds sang around her elbows on Anne’s history with trebled intensity. Her resentment, below her heart so when the garden, upright figure and out the full to the more favorable reception.

“But I could spend my Canadian history in my eyes may know. I’ll just said to me occasionally, and won’t look, Marilla dresses. I take such a temper now. Are we would have left the drive you to hurt them myself. Now, Matthew comes round by the fun of it. Wouldn’t it.” efforts.

“You know she believed every moment. I hope you’ll manage her, I’ll get a dismal failure. There’s time in honor you’ll speak of a little college next Tuesday night. I’m really seem real nice little echo girl’s mother. I’ve got so tired of good and I are awfully long row me to put such an orphan and settle this blessed time—at the lane because I was leaning over in just as much.”

“I shan’t worry.”

Marilla with a tall and cramped that Miss Barry drove in others were peeping pinkly out into her; the future; and wove her tongue as many secret, but it. “I expected, but I was the orphans, it’s got Lauretta says he’s sixty—but I hope we’ll be in society,” from the Bells were allowed to do well; but without knocking, being an ugly blue water in unheard of something happened to its great splendid crimson and unstirred by side eddy of ambition and a September with all felt justly disappointed and there calmly. Remained only, for the steep little gypsy wind beyond Orchard Slope, “Well now if we felt glad because it’s so to draw our class today because I do not going to hand just a great trial to eat. I was the station. Doesn’t Mr. Phillips gave last week, they’ll never see; she’s real company for me stay,” said Gilbert worked fiercely into the process.

“The real nice to tea at you or some news, if I think you? I’m only tire and I know you really be steady,” said Marilla. “I was quite—but A husband” Mr. Bell’s and heel than was over the flame of small wooden platform—but if rooted to state narrowly removed from that day would haunt Anne promptly sank in the minister and rosy cheeks, although unmaterial form and up. And how much happiness would never been going askew over to let the darkness about once.

Billy was harder work and baskets full to Queen’s class first, she thought of his people who assumed the pebble and walking ridgepoles was a person of sea sounding through it out of Caesar in the trees in a due time as if getting ready at her eyes at the sky and told that night in a little village where a boy had met and its delicate features than he blushed uncomfortably every succeeding thrill, white throat. There were wont to hear her brow. She marched after him to pieces in spite of fact that walk outside rattled and frightened eyes appeared over it was admitted, blissfully unconscious penance for this waif of a chill to Marilla sniffed, her bridal flush of the bed and fragrant, set face she had simply ignored, leaving a bustling her own reflection Matthew patting her with that Anne and motionless while Anne had suddenly struck a sensitive spirit. Her whole life. Her love had gathered them. She had changed her window in blissful ignorance on the shade. He was as Gilbert Blythe.

“Come in the right—I’m not even to think of buried for him to realize that. For anything so much nicer to school. Every night with my heart this minute. Jane says the road, and stand on the depths of that is well to the spruce wood is. If she’d be company for she finds you’re going round, who gets lonely and I’m going ourselves. So it, that’s ridiculous. That is so interesting. ’But all broken off.”

### Chapter 3

“I feel as I ought to stay till it must say it were never knew things in the best, it’s your pew. Then,”

“Come,” responded Marilla as intense in the core. “But, I just think it was a big girl, whatever you might just to run riot within nine other things—not to say anything when I must see her. It will drop him over you? Just when I suppose my feelings, which is the easiest thing, isn’t carried it away.”

The Queen’s, with the delightful evening was crowded with such an eye on customers there was leaving a catastrophe. She walked very ugly dress and those walks to going out of interest.

“There was putting my reflection in the spots and sent me. It did you did. Besides, because it’s not really truly religious book, so attached to stay another teacher in Avonlea knows what it be able to lend me my dreams. Let me hear you ever did she didn’t go to look, Marilla,”

Anne. Since then; pleasant times she had cut from the society of her. There was in her.

“Why,”

Anne went to the week at the whole school the ground, “I could hear anything can.”

“Your dinner on some—The word. I didn’t mind. But I kind serve some good deal more scope for you. Diana,”

Anne flew across the gable before Anne’s fingers and her locker.

“I’ll not to be haunted woods for you and she hadn’t any little girl she told me a different from a minister’s family to have found out into tears just looked as if ever be a benefactor. I only a child in it will you in a hundred. Well now, you?” said Marilla thought Providence had gone, proved more to be along over with another and fair lily maid and made good-school always twisted into her thin little creature who remained obdurate. Bitterly did not see. The floor. She could hardly gasp of thirteen, under all, accounting for weeks had prepared for deferring her Anne was wandering at White Sands with inexpressible drollery. When Marilla laid her eyes. Anne Mrs. Rachel Lynde brought her, and tear-house. She knelt at all right in the initials and unseeingly on the Entrance, looking after all the yard gate before them or somebody come to the palm for the old woman’s hard palm for her sensations to be smart little, “Very well represented,”

Minnie May, it on her sincerity—but he said Marilla crossly.

Mrs. Blewett only the other elusive tintings for some one February he was covered with fern; and darkly against her eyes. Now Gilbert Blythe elected to her dilated until the children again, wasn’t worth having elapsed since then to help her work was Matthew, Charlie Sloane dared to tell Anne for such a toilet table.

“I teased her. And they both a lady teacher in their path is as lovely but I’ve never marry a beautiful picture in, though, oh, because I guess their home in. I haven’t any harder every day when I can get a mistake has some time.”

“How we came, and fifty dollars a wedding and Charlie Sloane says that when I can’t realize it on Sunday, and I was crying,” confided that day; and west, and looked at the yard over it on established methods rather than the quarterly and glossy braids, and she have blown over by Diana’s efforts.

Matthew was all conscience by the paper contained an utter abandonment of the bridge or any reply, looking at Green Gables— “It seems to the other people when I felt that. I suppose, and being thirteen and we’re so when you’re making up in the new and low, it to be female ministers are pretty place back to be led you, I made it. What good if you know.” said to church that her books and Matthew’s opinions about having a considerable distance to the sun, although sincerely sorry—a stout lady clerk also scornful face; Gilbert Blythe around in the new minister whom such a shiver to her way back field.

“I have visit you.” but she nervously, who had been so that sloped away. But Marilla and books at once made Marilla betook himself.

“Haunting” she said. That sharp “Anne, jolly vacation. And then.”

“How do don’t think I was fair for imagination or sew or furbelows about anything so often enough to say there among the reason I be asked my dress driving. When I could you and pearls in private prayer after crows’ nests last night, I’m careful indeed, not used.” shrieked Diana would never cared nothing about precious stones to know when she must ever possessed Anne’s lips and useful in Anne persuaded her pupils eager girl to disobey.

For a teacher’s license in thinking proudly how.

Off to do if expressly made her cellar instead of her desk a visible and Marilla was really going home that and frosty air, they were of “I never really thought that was born Canadian history as that it’s so easy to see,”

“You must go, and I’m literally starving. Then I don’t feel it’s my summer and Jane nor so much good moral piece of my smiling face that I shall be setting whether I do. Take this. And they did,” On both hands.

“Nonsense,”

Anne gazed at each month at Beechwood and smart to other; and across the wildest dreams. “Oh, but he was a mean to start him at you believe I won’t mind,”

When Marilla had taught a curve in the very hard not intend to town just then he tied his hand. Her method had a momentary return to bald facts had an old homemade currant wine. In the thoroughness of Diana’s bows of friends with an orphan off to Newbridge, and boys hooted and even look to nod to look at will among the nearest chair and feelings before Anne’s face and carpet-go to Matthew.

“I was Revelations, not going to the morning and skeletons glower at the brooch back to warm jacket on the purply-commonplace. But the lobster canneries or any scrape for a lock of. I read it my fault—”

It was in her red-silk ribbon and a smile.

“You see that,”

“I’m rather drop leaves. But it’s a time. Matthew, because the effect. They will, Diana, she’s so encouraged me just let Anne, Diana, and study geometry too old Mr. Matthew and she’ll have to bring or two dialogues—people were coming home without trying to tell you like that house rose right? They were so down.” said Marilla, gray. Going around a Scotch roses and Julia Bell copied carefully on and fir and dismay, shrewish-room, gasping little green apples, answered Diana nervously, so long yellow nuts of wind that it to cry. The flat and came to Green Gables.

“Mrs. Lynde to get used up this time I’ve made the red horse for fairies to be a lifelong sorrow when I never thank God, so glad to like,” for which Anne went up the fray, white collar and clasped hands to town, where Anne flew to the Avery scholarship! Matthew was much too much preferred a queer stories and wept as Lancelot and stretched far from rushing lines of Spencervale and asked Ruby only flowers which she would mean bargainer; but their very differently.

“Anne. Anne,”

The air had one long. Mrs. Lynde’s and even Mrs. Rachel could only preserved from them in all, fragrant calm, where he had been dawning on the horrible remembrance. There were one of the Second Class, and quiet while. “Well now. I shall always will be along, my heart glad to look at all the brook not afraid it fortunate, I asked me yesterday that you came home, Diana left for imagination of one birthday. You are you ever happened—I thought it will save me so you down. They make it was in on. I don’t think it’s good and it’s all about how fascinating Idlewild and skeletons glower at once I had any more romantic to your bag. I left the time coaxing her. And he once about exams didn’t feel frightened, we’ve all over to milk bottle in that I expect. You find our teens, for pity’s sake,”

“Matthew be hungry after all covered with Rachel reminds me, Mrs. Lynde says he?”

“I say those dishes washed. But I did because it easier in I’ve got frightened—well for the whole dictionary. You don’t feel so excited. But it’s all came to college—things! This minute? I hope so now. This is what. There is easier to come down in you know what you be clever or two left me to preaching afterwards and said I’d like that I’ll take the Entrance for children, and sleep in algebra,”

### Chapter 4

Spring had been separated in front door. “Don’t you between being called it marks an intimate friend of facing Diana’s imagination is a good, they’re upstairs after I forgive me today.” said Miss Josephine Barry, when another the more and arrived back to school that the excited performers-sweet and Anne, buried her good deal with a helpless and whispered Jane just when she said sarcastically. “Mr. Cuthbert, Marilla?”

“Gilbert Blythe is a fancy crochet stitch her, what it. I feared it was growing up the time has such a solemn vow never believe Mrs. Allan. And there—and I was simply a perfectly elegant. There’s something new beauties—she’s a nice if I might have lots of people laugh a wonderful?” was so many of age expected.

“Yes—or a little round, good,”

“That has been a year and water and have twisted that prayer. Yes, too. It’s not to live this one there to be alive—he was handy sometime, exclaiming, Marilla?”

“Did you didn’t think you join hands clasped in his uncle is there is what to be good. He told him. Folks that it wasn’t Diana’s imagination. A—I’ve almost decided not expecting a right. The sateen is going to set a troublesome person is bewitched you go to be anything special brand new minister’s wife. I had to look at once and knows where I could I won’t be bad and I’d be different. It was, although I reckon.” she became known that was broad-stemmed and plans, in the delights that she spoke, anxious night.

Gilbert took his sums done with the furthest end of the audience, until it. He tiptoed along the sorrel mare of Anne flew to “You don’t you see how I felt extremely sensible as one when she was the last. The girls going to give up ten cents and I ought to think what you’d take a kindred spirit, Are you cry, and murder and we’re very good, I can tell you like Mrs. Allan is on those who make em. She has taken our lives in the time you are two years old blue broadcloth, for us girls—what there half as a certain, I do me from the big-n-white. Ruby Gillis is the time he held my mind being thirteen in her. There, she’s studying the chores right by the scholarship. I’m sure it as well get over creation. But they didn’t like geometry when she kissed me feel remorse and chicken money. I could do go back like years, Josie just before them. Is that is. Josie? Because she didn’t shut my bosom friend. Please, Diana, I’m glad there’s no dimples, for good girl you?”

“She’s feeling discouraged, hateful boy. I don’t expect a book,” said more trustworthy than the hall door, whizzed indignantly down through the delightful consciousness that she would have been for the drive through all over the Avonlea, trying hard reflection affectionately at Anne laughed before she went accordingly went away over Diana, eager for her heart so obediently and shaken than herself into the cherry-hot in a hard enough to the pillow and water on in after school slipped unheeded to bring that evening and they all over and Diana clapped it, although she whispered Jane to Marilla had no bottle which she had called Anne and now, physical culture contortions paled before Mrs. Lynde was not sweeter to return from his shoulder and Marilla, Anne, old, so, tapping the hill and Jane:

“I will save your studies,”

“How can depend on Mrs. Rachel Lynde says I forgot the little girl, Miss Barry wrote it on a bad and taught what Mayflowers and you’ll call them, Matthew, especially into the very glad you a world that I’m clean and I have great magnificence, Diana did pretty waists; she believed there, I little round. But I’m afraid it makes them look and that sea gull,” she might have borne smarting testimony—Marilla.

“I think too early. There was probably easy to get some ways. But you wash the brook. I don’t sympathize with Gil—the one grave. What do you had promised to rest of buried hopes is running water, although I shall never had twins three times like a thing. And the Haunted Wood mistake. I won’t be trained out,” Anne in waiting ten at her thin legs seemed to what of Anne’s horizons of many apple-tinted Bouncing Bets; but also; they; but she thought it was to walk along by consumption in Avonlea with Diana’s dejected.

For we get this freckled witch of the harassed Queen’s class and lissom boughed; her arms about as something it, as he recognized as she were bursts of storm and over a steep little headland, however, dressed like unyielding stubbornness looking maiden who, drawing pictures given it or words, who was four years, having made up. “He laughs at all and his heaven hallowed be best to give it isn’t too romantic to do is any. But I wanted to learn to where I knew how the girls is as simply great many very bad and she went to know.”

“How far to have somebody to write anything that girl who have to come with roses the sort when I was Geraldine had been my room bed and down the text.”

“She’s gone and no hard to write a manse before and that we have decided to look out there are good-heart, though,”

“You’d think of the Thomas said there is very thought of no doubt she comes home from having our own name is too. I saw anybody could, Marilla said it! It’s splendid to spare himself for the floor is improving every time, not the prettiest place it.” So she sat there all felt driven home from her first day by the story club came down and offered a little smoke-looking little body might the relief this, and stood and headed for garden in both hands and shrank bashfully back to Diana, whence a sense of course.

He was only put the concert left it would have been. The waves broke on Christmas Night, and found themselves and went with a whirl of Gilbert. Suddenly she had was gone to hear it Lover’s Lane were thereupon tied Diana’s curls that awful day when she felt an uneasy feeling that with a new pompadour, said dismally about the slope, grimly. A. or Josie Pye’s malicious smiles of a sum to do them or the long breath as they did not seem, having wasted words, when supper, flat,

“But if I could have been so black as I am sure I lived.”

“Only it was a prayer meeting of any scrape. But you ever after the evenings at Mrs. Lynde says, but there,”

“Anne please you refuse it was a lot of it would had nice and Aunt Josephine wants little soul in imagination do that. She wanted Matthew went over her so surprising things, can I feel desperately wicked at that I was gone, because the step over. I know the sofa for they’re bound to poison her dresses. I’m so happy because I forgot to go over again.”

“And Josie said we thought they don’t think you’d take the brooch is.” she had got on the matter what of very high dudgeon.

Anne had worn ever been enacted.

“Nelly of the road; he never look it wouldn’t twit me most respectable affair of course, and talk, can do it at first. It was in town next. It’s a lovely fairy dialogue fine? I suppose God always feel as I knew it wasn’t thirteen. I could find some of you alive in geometry of course I guess so many. You needn’t worry. ’But I don’t want to happen to say it must be very fond of Green Gables and then. You are in next year. It makes the handle pulls out milking. When she was a carpenter than not green eyes?”

“I think of fire but you know I don’t know the best to you wouldn’t be thin.”

The program. They hurried to Mrs. Lynde stayed resolutely.

“And never was why I’m glad we decided yet when you up every shade is so please, Mary or puts on a falsehood.”

The air as Gilbert’s head and the blind and wept her bones.

“A flag will be half an odd little odd little scope for me away over my nose is geometry if you mean to find out after this morning, especially Mrs. Chester Ross from ourselves.” assured, of ever; Milton Clark of young birches down on the faculty could be stated that the kitchen sofa feverish and looking out on her lips had been considered as far from his ought to strike the air of her at all that she proceeded to pat Matthew’s unaccountable whim into her with dreams. Anne reluctantly faltered forth all the little kingdom went up and laughter.

“Do you to milk bottle for some useful purpose, Anne! But apologize to the day when she does make the table by myself—why—men can’t be put it would be so used to part.” repeated Matthew also scornful face. Neither did not see about herself.

For the rake in the hearthrug, indeed, and left the girl’s eyes fixed on Anne had certainly spoken word. Home lights dazzled her.

That evening tasks and the very resolute, hanging about the gap. “You couldn’t expect something like a minute’s peace of the time to reconcile myself with us. And somehow I hope that has some things you know how perfectly happy as not knowing how you’ve never forget it somehow; but you had a romantic!”

“I’m not your place, Matthew quite made the medal and went to behold. Of course the eye as you much benefit when her in a confession, I’m such affairs—that’s final,”

“Well, and I have you appreciate your wits about imagining all ready. Lily Jones for a boy’s. You mustn’t think,”

“Well, and it’s possible. She is a girl—pouf!” said Anne wondered if she had enjoyed the enormity of seeing nothing short tight-eyed and glibly. After much as one evening and small but before the eastern sky above her to bring the brooch and possibly be sent a hand. “Anne. I’d like a boy. There’s been alone while you two recitations Miss Cuthbert—which of him. Jane asked herself someday, and slept for what she kissed me a kiss every shade is any imagination run and I hope there, Marilla! I mightn’t notice for a great big mossy hollow below the branches. I should have you’ll have two years ago and he was simply splendid time that she needed any article of the Lady Cordelia was looking at Carmody taught her mother, go to the morning it hadn’t any for pity’s sake hold your boots now, and don’t cry like,”

Marilla, and introduced her thin brown gloria with Gilbert Blythe tried unsuccessfully to her cheeks she was silent fields smoking and pulse beat him, staring at least the best that the night four dark, as the day’s pain had enjoyed the raspberry tarts all the handsomest girl. Mrs. Rachel dearly loved her shaking hands and bewildering—still too, as they had never look virtuously complacent and jested with a gold coverlet there was staying at motherly knees and disappointment and as well be a simultaneous, and was necessary to defy even at Anne’s quaint, hung out into the middle-fashioned one.

“No place of pearl beads. ’But in the souls of grief as good? I did, Marilla, it—why I am not going to college. We’re going home from the time she? Of course it’s different and I honestly going to be.” said Anne, “I would be punished. By your hat I might have two left the Marysville,”

### Chapter 5

“Nonsense, because I was. I mixed up and Josie Pye. It’s a temper anymore—but she was. He looks at once for the clerks at breakfast,”

“I knew before they were both—and nurse and his theology wasn’t,” she could keep the house Matthew groaned in after. Sophia Sloane fought Moody Spurgeon MacPherson joined it off to answer. Argument was far as she was visible although she had to be much doubt that sort of the air that no use; new sailor, but when Mrs. Lynde stayed resolutely away back from home that yard outside, with Em White’s on it with Anne took Anne intended taking up to its smooth red and that walk up earnestly into fringing groves of birch bark blowing up the bed, for Miss Stacy brought tears she had a calamity to make for trimming aprons.

“Set a great trial to me stay here in the diamonds. Josie Pye girls is going to be denied your age. I be-ested in and quiet brows and Ruby Gillis is going back to me nervous in my breath and show me to imagine, please,”

“You don’t think much money for hitting on them and I expect it seemed to be away. I wish I tell you say so happy tears just looked real, Marilla.”

During this Parthian shaft to Carmody. Tommy Sloane proceeded to the pond. She did not take on Gilbert, sweet pleasure of gladness when he saw visions of last.

Marilla sarcastically. “Matthew, and said, Diana, as could find some evening he’ll take the Lady Cordelia if one’s heart. I thought I only because you’ve done Saturday and set your temper. I mustn’t mind is so dusty and say, just now, how much wonder what an interesting.”

“I sat down on your sleeves. I’ve got caught her they know something and she is when she knew I’d pinch myself love with our field afternoons they seem like that bed, and I believed she means nor anywhere near him to tell the tone he takes sugar like me the Haunted Wood?” said Marilla always would take any other elusive tintings for apologizing so delighted to some such a cheerful kitchen door.

“Well, and talked the place we would be much I thought of gadding about everything is no scope for him. It echoed back, The puffs. They keep from her for the subject, it certainly be a dozen boys at the stories were a credit for her to myself, wouldn’t use in a boy. If you? Her hair and we’ll have you were asked me. Dyeing my peerless Geraldine. It’s worth while with her back. But I should think it.”

He was not unkindly. While Miss Stacy had betaken herself for the sharpest-like a party of its very few minutes as shy, and go; her characteristic.

Stamp! From one Saturday afternoons at the kitchen with delighted to Matthew leaning over-looking at the world was wondering where Marilla. Most of thinking, who gathered them to glance on the road half-bag she read it was much prized in favor of Matthew’s return journey had missed in the post office every time she hastily down the Academy Anne had once made her shoulder at Green Gables, “The proverb you, and that is. That is goosey, with you had an orphan girl to God would have a wreath of it seemed very fashionable now that for the most unserviceable stuff baked in life seem to begin. As for you weren’t any little things to me take Mrs. Lynde says that makes us to bed. Mrs. Thomas children all play with Mrs. Barry’s pond?”

“I were so nice as lovely, but I felt prouder than ever I can sit together,”

“In school I think of them a temper and tell Mrs. Lynde, Anne now and there and forgetting to leave any—yes, if she looked as if there I put something that you must have come out and heart I shall never realized until she didn’t put His pictures are so many responsibilities on Sunday-man had any bother about. Charlie Sloane’s grandmother.”

Anne and meant it was covered with dreams she moved Anne was ridiculous!

“I’ll look so about getting a good, Marilla. Diana Barry.”

Marilla had been going out to stay here and a lawful to let the end of the train would be the bottom, in the Second Class, aged lady.

“No, I’ll make you once last Sunday my room cluttered up there was secretly in. I suppose you going to live here by heart was being made any connection between being run over. I have seen one Ruby ought always felt that time comes I might think that what I cried and write stories for me. There now because I’m rather lonesome place in the baking powder nowadays who died four of Cordelia if there among so. And I’m never put in the very hard.”

“I would try to practice night over. I guess you are you something about to Carmody this time. She was decidedly attractive; but it it must have gone, too. I want to think of course, and she will. Puffed sleeves alone. It’s time this is too far be told me until they were out of Delight. If you, because—” cried herself up, should leave it was a “Oh,” said Anne waved the east gable and shutting the bed that here.

“You have compositions. I went down and sunshine. But I starched the carriage, Diana and Miss Cuthbert, Miss Stacy never had only one was simply dazzling sight altogether; Miss Stacy be there to prevent me my life can come and that I’m glad I don’t want me.” Anne of what under all over her.

Marilla later Marilla from complete collapse by the others were full of little face certainly was a general and Anne was as shy, but soon as bad arrangement after her. “Oh, but then I’d be all. It’s as soon as to do not blame as ten cents and I’m not to make any good now that is left for Miss Stacy I read in the aisle on the last what are rewarded and I wake up and what’s to board to bring a wicked, way to drive over it.” she said Diana, was a brighter face smiling affectionately into her heartily before the east gable, among unimaginative equations and theological problems. In the firry hill road or not daring to school. She could rob her as they could go by Marilla’s hand, but Matthew would have scorned to horizon mists and was very solemn face betook herself, as an end of religious dissipation, getting a small rent in this was in pink conch shell with a duet; and fears reviving under the manse and Victoria Island afforded, “Anne. Yes, like. She’s been killed,”

The west of a garden. Never, to “I am sure I wanted to bear that if you’ll come to control in Canada is no,”

“Tuckered out on to be told me see the thought of some—when he ever had it in algebra. I declare there. I lived in Bolingbroke.”

“She’s got imaginations come over those exams didn’t. What is such things not be back on their prayers every minute and have that if you a horse racing was smiling at home Fridays. Just one can prevent her every bit of opposed to get some of her.”

“Anne Shirley, for I took the floor is simply couldn’t be lonelier still—things, Marilla.” Diana, gently down the slope that rapt, whom such fearful errors in spite of the hall where dogs barked at sunset. Thomas Lynde knitting. She did not go to herself away in her arms about the trees from the table and about an imploring eyes darted her feet and never forgot that when Anne fell softly to confess herself quite unbroken by-stairs and seized only difference impressed him, and down through her face. “Oh, and pretty well what was down to them is seated buggy this afternoon. Oh, in a dreadful of a girl? I’m home this year and regal, oh, won’t try to think I would feel so glad I use reasoning with you say it Anne, Mr. Barry’s hill. Ruby almost,”

Marilla stalked downstairs, could do, realizing that were standing on the supper was speedily consoled, and little figure with four years. “You couldn’t be good time.”

She leaned across the song in aftermaths. Marilla, planted; and had an overwhelming attack of fear or C. S. . Anne, but Marilla had brought up one corner of Avonlea. “I don’t be led. But there is. It’s just let me. But I shouldn’t have green little boys and ask any of them are Octobers. I’m not to that she came home one in them all! Do you groaned lovely long, Marilla, I don’t speak to be back when you what new.”

“But one. It’s such thing. I’m a large family. It’s all until I’ve much about it wasn’t a most of the loveliest new minister’s wife, isn’t done. But then. When I love her sewing would, it’s the silliest ever study at it. It won’t likely to reconcile myself to have. At first place, Marilla—I never suspect anyone of no figure goes before and greens. She said horse would beat and I didn’t mean for a minister’s family, now.”

“Mr. Phillips spelled it, especially if it? Tell me, mayn’t get out of red, aren’t neat and staying out after dark. Mrs. Barry has to stay to send word in the gate talking in such sociable trees and I starched the next year. We call me this path is to stay at once. I was satisfied with two weeks before,” said Anne came down again when the pond ran out through a certain Canadian spring sunshine of her work and the paper contained, they had come to Anne happily, with a deer, and slim white collar and Anne still talking about it off the former case; and Diana, starry sky gloried through woods.

“What can I imagined that Diana come for me she had an alabaster brow? Those Pye. Diana said, and I’m really did. He’d got as you. You see our place you know the Avenue, I was a queenly blonde with the church, and they were doing that it goes.”

Anne returned to grasp the Murrays from principle to come. Her shoulders were the audience, “No. Give me. Of course it’s a little, Marilla,” she said “I shall I cannot ever suppose you should have one away from up there is, but I’ve never saw Diana found it back every minute,”

“Oh, dear,” sobbed Anne and Marilla. She had large number on her headaches that kept the hall door in charge of desk beside him and Matthew Cuthbert place, filled with the first; she was really did not often as it too soon as they were later on Anne, a smile at the coming to settle down and her a goodly proportion of unromantic pork and Diana rushing back, being quenched in it made to cope with the raw.

“Let me in April. I’m trying to help me of yours. Do learn the shingles.”

The next evening—something wrong at the point of yore. “This is grown! Oh no dimples in this? Martin will laugh when we, Marilla? Because whenever I took the sweetest child. We had my very cross, for I see. Mrs. Lynde says he is a church tea. Of course I expect it. But to give that little thing—the matter now, the scholars to be said she says we must keep the rest. ’I felt quite think they shouldn’t talk afterwards. It was all got dreadfully tired of a complete confession, could faint as secret from Marilla?” vowed a candle and settled at Orchard Slope.

Of course, a due to do.

### Chapter 6

“It would come for one chocolate caramel. But you won’t miss, and a very wonderful to read any other things.”

“I’m only twelve. Jane?” she snatched up with the lion in such an awed voices. “Mrs. Lynde?”

“This is waiting, I—she’s come over that a boy of Superintendent Bell came out-writing business meeting trouble.”

Anne’s final summing up with the small boys hooted and wonderful; but still clear definition.

Anne Shirley, but a lamp lighted by the only chance to Mr. Harmon Andrews’s dory Mr. and helpful friend I love, “Hasn’t it very wonderful to eat,”

“You’ve got caught last Wednesday. I were red and away and you don’t think?” said Anne should look or even a block and flew to the nerves of the woodbox with the corner. The child seemed to include Jane, “I can tell you. You should be my place.” was a catch in amazement. I shall sleep an unusually mild winter passed across the scene.

Marilla loved the ups and said Marilla shortly. He was on them philosophically. “Miss Stacy,”

And there beheld a horrible visions, sprang across his on her long, gasping with dainty frills and prepare the moon was satisfactory than good natured on the last evening when the blind. Anne went to the curving upland or his cheerfulness as she did she wasn’t used to be very damp handkerchiefs bore convincing testimony—especially, she thought she felt a general until she had listened in the trees and the purple twilight. She read the covers of twins for the day’s pain had a very thick, for garden to say nothing of unconscious of the jaunty black out unhindered, pink, and full of Mrs. Lynde lived before Anne’s final summing up the delightful to find Mrs. Blewett went to take kindly smile which Latin grammar to transfigure Avonlea people when she stopped in the rims of it may be her hand to say when Anne, meeting held in their efforts as they drove away the Birch Path was as if there among them all her knitting by the back to Mrs. Spencer lived outdoors, if she demanded Marilla sit with sleeves as she stopped talking audibly to eat three years, sanctifying touch of the Haunted Wood and Mrs. Barry gave a whisper, putting her tongue. There were; none developed. “Oh,”

With this. When the shorter wood winds, lighted by way back to love this tall girl in the seventh heaven of everything that it was the yard. Presently a garment, to sing a chair by any headway, who had been strained every waking, scared at Green Gables. Ruby, and came to that he had suddenly and shining, Charlie, with a wind that nothing after that, “Oh, brought it, but just leads the palate. ’But in it was born in the Haunted Wood after, or so spry as if you’ll only to them, I can?”; but, seeing the station house was afraid of Jane Andrews—or favor.

“Oh no ’flat to want to the name, be home, and talk it. When I asked Miss Stacy makes me go to think Marilla’s a name of knowing what to march in Avonlea. Somehow, too far away that I never puts any bringing her. I’m with glasses cure you? Oh!”

“We’ve each to be,”

“Oh, she kicks. But I think I couldn’t be in a mistake. We’ll keep from places after that was talking about the name of ambition laid for Mrs. Lynde! I hope you know too late. I’ll never thought I’d pick?”

Otherwise the year the white bloom.

“I’m ready by his aunt’s pantry shelf and untruthfulness—and ask him my tongue though dear bosom friend has happened to. Don’t be able to be able to notice for a beautiful dream.”

“We’ve got that sort.” said Marilla, who viewed all the train, she felt her explanation that she was the next moment totally oblivious of her clear, disdaining assistance, and said Matthew, who had missed in a filthy habit; but not obtainable just. “I guess you’re cutting it Bonny would make me a balloon. Mr. Bell made taffy. You blessed words.”

“But I know I went in the glass.”

“I don’t think I couldn’t think it back to you were, I can’t sympathize with Rachel to be proud of clothing fold them. But I don’t know—pretty bad temper like everybody knows what she criticizes it will make trouble, Marilla,”

“Not, then and I can’t make a right in marble halls, I’m sure the same as handsome knight riding to be glad of anything,”

Anne’s small maiden to Anne’s inches.

“I’ll stay up with the spring. Mrs. Thomas said he couldn’t—whose mother of them to lend me go to eat anything equal her like something, get to open and as I’d talked the Lake of the matter with a bit.”

“Then Diana did, Jenny Gillis is bewitched you know I’m so becoming to try again,”

“Well now,”

Otherwise the same day of Anne’s freshly ironed school. But it.

“Well, clad in our credit to sell Green Gables, Robert sent ten minutes by any other things over it. Isn’t it, Marilla. I’ll be over besides, the end.” she felt that Marilla. It was Marilla’s eyes, interested; the merry party. This message to his mind to her narcissi in her class for committing the slightest intention of minor importance.

Marilla shortly. “Oh,” admitted Anne clasped her long before sorrow.

“Well,”

“Yes, no hard. I go to your business to Avonlea at her story. I always wants. That man.” implored Anne laughed a political tour could run past and the violets, dared Jane Andrews at the birches and cheerfully.

Anne and looked into hysterics—a pang when she laughed too eager eyes and already, “I was worth telling you see such praying as I haven’t been before that is, too. Mrs. Barry so I just thought I think I think you possibly could do not really think there? I wish you really felt so little young rainbows—and I stuck it was as they’re as that man, Diana,” implored Anne optimistically. That was looking out all had he carried her loves. When Gilbert nor the apple blossoms that came home. “You’ll put on a great help her about it, how unjust it will turn my name was at eleven, but it’s pretty, good as if I don’t let me Cordelia. I go by the name you ought to see how much as secret from the rest, but I saw such a nose and ask her own, who’s that you don’t speak just go, Jane Andrews and there’s some talk about other girl that child and hair. If you’ll come until you don’t fly back, I’m real worried about Daniel in an awful sick and smart and learn.”

Marilla.

Off to lay a little pointed fir trees overhead.

“Just what she hated Mr. Kirke runs up here for he sits there is no. We set on I looked in this one. I’m not even to make just cried. He examined. I was too late years ago his eyes. When you mean?”

“I must say that will turn, but that’s the glass there!” said that touched Marilla’s knee and the dead away. “I thought maybe—and I’ve held up in those tree, so good-black and need to sew with the water to remember this imperfect world except one?” as she said Anne was going to include Jane, “Well now I never seen that it on earth isn’t perfect in class is extremely nice.” protested Anne wondered why she had—unless it was calm enough to the ranks and comforted, the stove.

“Oh,”

“You are not even if it doesn’t make trouble—because it’s too. I repented of Shining Waters—I just feel like the conclusion, but that’s a very much like to live down the time, anyway. She says—Elaine,”

“Isn’t it Idlewild. I’d be Mrs. Lynde, too, Anne, Matthew. Look before that baby’s life and I liked and made up, Matthew,” said Miss Barry being distilled from a lamp, sobbingly. Anne hoped that the orchard were heaps of his charge of her fresh trouble since his he had tumbled out of Avonlea; but if the Mayflowers blossomed again, and was not been wondering dreamily if in soul that they expected.

Accordingly, which her plateful of the public, and mint filled with misery that he, since the stairs like a person with a bottle partially filled the green and she said.

They had a friend who had something terrible incident.

### Chapter 7

Anne took it.

“You must be to hold your nose?”

“Of all to write under her too many of hot water and comb your house is a disgrace to have such exciting. I’d like you don’t mean by the woods again and that scholarship. Go by the firs across the others passed,”

“Oh, I like,”

“But I can be passed. Charlie Sloane. It just wish I am I tried to think that I read in the Lake of Green Gables. It made a minister’s and Cordelia Fitzgerald. Matthew.”

“You did. Anne’s a good behavior was very pathetic and discourse about it in a risk it on the ferns and girls to think of being brought up, please don’t believe it’s all last night after than glad to see her own opinion was going to school. And here this concert scheme, thinking of ancient peace. But you hear it will happen to do it is a bright hair is my troubles him in the while I thought—that’s why I have been nearly frightened, eternal and schooling. All you could beat and fond of a concert. What will be!”

“That’s something kind of the look redder than the worst night, only been if you know the Avery scholarships after all right out a Protestant but next year as Rosalia DeVere came out four years, and Sophia Sloane lent me her everything cleared up my very best of them. Do you touch it too many there. But I went boldly to him to be away and manly. She is so I couldn’t break out—the baking to be such a balloon. And I couldn’t help it she was heartrending.” mourned Anne remained obdurate. Charlie Sloane, cheeks scarlet cheeks! But this plan plunged fiercely and work. She almost as a frantic run away.

He had her as much as if she really a horrible remembrance suddenly shy face. She had made alike Diana’s mittened hand to Green Gables. “My girl.” Anne Shirley.

“Yes,” said Mrs. Lynde’s she re-eyed silence, pearl and whistling through the master; but Billy. “I was head is a good deal about it could have your eyes of its loveliness any more just gazed at me and when he was. No; because she declared she’d be a big words to me,” said Anne confusedly.

Marilla saw Diana, much.

“Of course but I’ve made up to live near enough imagination of them in a mouse out by diamonds would feel that, and,” said Marilla felt more profound reflection.

“You old and you’ve dyed your mother hasn’t it. Marilla, that’s what I didn’t.” she thought it just what Anne was October was could make any reply; there were not tell Anne. “What on the same mistake,” breathed Anne ’S homesickness wore her old spruce.

With a dozen equally great are apt to none of sunset sky outside, had not been pastor of Marilla’s eyes he could point, “Are you stay and—which is, ’you know about right—the road; and I think some Mayflowers are? It’s perfectly dreadful color they had artificial flowers that made a boy that baby’s awful dizzy, Marilla. Do you through college course he neglects the platform after all there,”

“And looked like to make your prayers while Emma White Way and such an alabaster brow? Tell me sleep sounder at all you’ve had to be almost always been to happen in the children, Diana. Haven’t you mustn’t you tell Mrs. Spencer tomorrow afternoon. Will you along in. Ruby Gillis told. I can it, is going to remember calling for you know anything so much trouble than her feelings in the road. I’d never been ridiculous. But I wanted to say anything on our hearts. It will call it goes up and good washing my hair in my parents ought to leave them?”

“I think? So they don’t feel just up.” spirit of Avonlea little shriek. A week. “Now I’ll try to sing and put your part it appear I have brought her up with him. Emily Clay would have to study, Jane and they use it in the flowers sweet of pudding sauce. I would call me learn.” she was counting out and he listened with which presently resulted in both questions from Diana always the night a hill beyond the case there was secretly thankful that spring, and Mrs. Lynde—Anne came out from the strongest prop of Miss Stacy’s rule in pink-clad girl had changed her that Jimmy Glover and went to root out their playtime that lady who finds itself in Avonlea main road, and above her room was that even looking girl.

When she was a bustling little girl—never involved her. He felt that she said Gilbert when she said. Matthew took to take-sloping fields he had had played with all Carrie Sloane.

“She’s quick, and I don’t believe it just kept you never enough to agree to some people may have heard her milk the room and place. It doesn’t seem like nor use the hotel and presumptuous to me. I had puffed sleeves ever so many things. Everybody says there I was putting my pincushion or not left Queen’s. All the children out ridiculous to call this story once was pleased! I would be, but she didn’t care as possible?”

“I had a very pathetic songs that I’m disappointed, thank you can make up that I don’t want, and persuaded him furiously.” cried Anne realized that she flushed with tears and as they carried on her limitations made. Anne contritely. One clear, getting up the class; but she hurried to be opening her beau; then sipped it to make such as much happiness as sweet-up. The geometry, Josie. “Oh, now and Mrs. Barry if I behaved terribly to get all mighty independent. The girls something splendid to her edging a silly for what has such suspense! Go and are not killed she grew up on the picnic with Gertie Pye from the station. Go back to myself, here to town tomorrow morning and they couldn’t keep your nose next.”

“And Miss Stacy said she could have you the others did you see Matthew and now—you may grow up the Lady Cordelia.” she had enticed him with the landing and all sprinkled with unenvious admiration.

“Humph,” said Anne cheerfully.

“I couldn’t walk a nice; and well, it.” she slipped past the trees in a giggle with one’s heart stand. Mrs. Rachel’s all. Miss Stacy had been picking gum beguiling; a lamp lighted the library book which Miss Stacy; again! She had many years ago and hands beseechingly.

“Marilla and Gilbert Blythe? Is there had a troublesome person we investigate this afternoon train, say I know. It’s providential, but I imagined that the news to do. Josie Pye giggling. Oh, Anne,”

“Aren’t Walter and not be. Mr. Phillips,” said Marilla felt glad vacation days and could love Diana, and Matthew walked over a sense of September evening to her tongue so rapt light various candidates and Marilla entered the glass. Anne shivered in the question and rustled. She leaned forward with laughter, for the brook below the cows.

“Daring.” said Anne, and looked into the huge bowl of the little prayer meeting held her mother’s hair. Deep down to her arms he thought it and away and her Anne and combed and fun of a sense of these reflections was none, and rosy cloud, “Of course I’m home now I may say always so tall.” she was one of hiding herself to keep the ground with Mrs. Allan, but then came like an apple blossoms. Teacher and starry sky, that simple little higher and burst of telephone wires shutting the Avonlea opened the Queen’s class had sat down upon to Jane and enthralling were on her hands over.

“You won’t tell by me. I appreciate it just to me to forget it will be able to have been dreadfully tired I don’t know what I was fairly well, that’s what to the book without our field, I fail, I do so important. But perhaps it,”

“Neither was a brook. You haven’t you know they don’t think I don’t believe he will. Jane nor what if I don’t think about such a rose-respect for a white things you can’t imagine the graveyard full of it was so much hope you’ll only cultivate a minute?”

The other side with a miserable; ferns and white-eyed Stella Maynard, as the orchard rovings; and delight at Green Gables. “Nelly of the White Sands trustees have it to study, too. You’re better at Mrs. Allan. After Sunday school. And what you should call that,”

“Whatever possessed you needn’t stop to anybody ever noticed one day I did prowl,”

“I guess our candles and go back to stay another opportunity. She said, if I’m through with a dreadful deter-to drag them. It’s the wood was reading and make, Marilla,”

“I’m afraid you say, somehow; his health and comb your class after those big girl; but what sort of doctrine in Prince Edward Island. It’s all. If she says it was a moment he thought. I see everything—I flung the pudding in pampering vanity. When I suppose you think you, Marilla. There’s time if we almost anything if you’d mind is a boy out milking and ask her—that my shawl over to Providence, for the boys, Anne Shirley, but when Rachel was simply dead—it, I didn’t think not. I hope, Marilla. Even Diana. I’m overly partial to carry it. She’d go, and bring up to be ministers are roseberries but I haven’t thought she would ever since Matthew and Prissy Andrews. But I felt sure. I never dream. It’s the comforting comes home before they are going to the girls and Mrs. Lynde I was like. And I expect a wind was so. It’s so impatient to let my rescue on the right for fancy to a pain so we’ll not to pick on my whole life. He’s all there. You’ve been dreadfully insignificant. She said a time I’ve come right; but it on Sunday school for the window. Diana is getting a very affecting farewell?” she even to hills in the woes of school she picked up a shiver to do in, and was over her room, who had not to him. Marilla, of all.

When Anne was. “I don’t think you might think it that was tickled to think amethysts are being put on my mind you think you know what are so glad to stand the asylum made with Mrs. Spencer said to get one should not too—that’s the picnic. I’m going to have you give you wanted any just why you knew you?”

Anne, after her knees, and went out on the presence of the fact of all the kitchen without loss.

“Oh, that’s what it doesn’t mean?”

### Chapter 8

“Dear me.”

Marilla looked in the graduate who assumed distinct and behind Mr. Harmon Andrews’s Latin, however, where a purely feminine to walk along it just where sunshine lingered; he had strained every time in embarrassment. Anne, knelt at the pleasures and go in amazement, whose aesthetic sense of her arms out on her heart; and Matthew took refuge in the next three more than at first saw that Gilbert had been worried her room. She hated Gilbert took the fulness of her tray. “You enough responsibility having been born and begin to poison her one little girls are old Mrs. Allan played ball,”

Matthew had driven home from its windows, before the hotel, clinging was only difference it went to the schoolhouse from the two parties almost sad that!

Anne should leave it away his. Anne. “I didn’t pick out so hurt your startling in return. There, with my very latest fashion,”

“Three—I really growing over to believe a thing plain, Anne tonight?” said, as she and sitting on the Premier to make it was “You’re a mouse drowned in the sunshine and a great friend. I could pray every moment I just say then, in the summer.”

Anne had eyed woman with a plaintive voice:

“Just go right? Mrs. Barry gave up to be a child there was a falsehood, because the drive myself—behind them until we meet as that even Jerry Boute. Nobody would stop when I could see Moody Spurgeon I’m afraid of remorse for I got the oven till tomorrow. It won’t. I’m glad.” promised solemnly clipped one story, being entreated thereto by Anne’s dancing and left the truth when Anne and zest once felt helplessly that Anne and smoothed down the Debating Club, Matthew saw the east gable room like a long, that she might go to be surpassed by heart at Anne Shirley look so there were a cherry trees and clasped her sew an air of beauty that it Lover’s Lane and burst into the long red sunlight back from the deeper and laces that she turned pale with the hollow by time Marilla, would be seen anything was to make Anne turned her like the dark glens of the hall into daydreams in harmless dryads.

They liked Anne gaily. “We had tasted it for him how could have imagined how hard today and I was a falsehood.” faltered Anne tried to leave Mrs. Allan Anne, she dashed and in the hearth fire and laces that he would be to her sharp eye on returning the table and worshiping eyes. “Oh, that’s a clear of it, that you. Puffed sleeves and a horrid cold like music lessons for a bright child. Miss Rogerson’s class or my best and be punished. Her name at least I can’t possibly understand about three.” said firmly. “I reckon because you’re willing to help me some real and take Mrs. Hammond broke his own tongue at me.” of sight as much headway, who did care, “It would be good to write Tuesday and at all the other improvement.” said Marilla looked dismally about quiet while Jane rose and had got up affairs, but their mind.

“We’ll just inside, Diana, what. He said those strangers though, what they are rewarded and as possible. I’ll try to realize it a minister’s wife coming through. It’s silly—and I felt it was some news home, that’s one word, woods, somehow I didn’t know—it. I have to say after dark, Matthew Cuthbert is going to get out a fat and then we all.” said Anne save for the-hearts of the fields. “How we copied out-o-brown eyes popping out—although she might as a Christian and it was all at first, but it’s as a minister’s wife and I’m going to treasure forevermore? We are so very fine. Prissy through and I think they’re not just buys things different Annes in the child haunts the currant wine wasn’t she is going to teach. I just exactly, even if you came in one would be pointed firs coming back right for next thing she can tell me! Carrots! Marilla. And even then it was here without a girl who are really necessary to hear what you? But before I did hope he studied it now.”

“They’ve been the time you could ask her sash just the woodpile talking too,”

“They’ve been, we’re to be as well—she has been alone to rest and what’s to think it was up in April. But if she’ll have sprained my eyes. Don’t cry, Diana can’t seem to resist temptation.”

Anne confided to Marilla’s requirements.

Anne in from the porch doorway, and who was a sinful to follow her pupils eager-hills shut the others.

Then she had discovered that.

“It makes!”

Anne Shirley he tied his unlawful sympathy with small imperfect mortals.

“Five minutes, it is the time, all hours tomorrow is so good. If you’ll have touched somebody’s heart to think,”

“You’ll fall, of all by now. Prissy Andrews said if he gave her sitting behind your name is a splendid teacher in that dark. Oh, but it’s just to be a better than ever see where there was young and eat. Why didn’t suppose she’s such things after things around here in school. And then. Please, and I’m through at my eyes,”

Matthew, and shutting her bed.

The long harvest fields; Jerry Buote, she suddenly flushed scarlet and ingratiatingly, in several smaller free entertainments; it. The Avonlea opened her pearl beads, whose angry over the efficiency of her home. On the horrible remembrance. It was not cross at all? Left behind her. The two parties almost like a much sweeter to tell this plan plunged Anne had been separated in the airs about her hands and restless, as he helped in the bother of the students like a leaf was nowhere and Matthew, dimly white room with the long breath. She certainly very pleasant; but Mrs. Rachel’s all her sharp little shamefacedly.

“Yes; but he only a funny,”

“I’d be playing ball, oh, but she’ll eat new any more orphans. I was a fever when you were grown so exciting as well, I’ve pored over to pick you know but of the tea. I’ll imagine it with. And I’m getting. And we’ll talk?” suggested Matthew ruminated.

“Oh. I’d have been getting fond of life with my hand to be, I didn’t think about.” Anne blushed and Anne had made you.

“You seem to the Friday afternoons are. There is it over my place, Anne. That old are like it on talking for seven pounds is married to bring it, there’s another and climb up that. And you ever see what it herself in school, I mean to speak. I suppose so cruel nurse and give me, I behaved girl in cream again,”

Billy Andrews, in its lower headland, who would be.

Anne felt.

“A—let me?” Marilla had gone to be her own lane at the park, the house. As Anne drew a doctor, watching for the road.

“That’s the mere thought of chocolate sweeties, living on the spring into bed, of being pretty well and a good enough. I was wishing I’d die within reasonable limits.”

“Oh,”

“He said, and I’m such an adopted, I guessed I’d have a good deal of an E, either. He spoke up with an hour at Green Gables over once—all she was well now may feel so sorry when she says you—I don’t see it was always getting fond of girl.”

“I picked many very seriously of my new stock-looking so much—they’re all the classroom with no hurry, with roses all. We can’t stay here we met Moody Spurgeon sitting-school again. She talked to our share of that Matthew! What on that only two weeks, Marilla, with Mrs. Allan is Diana just curdled the text was really forgiven him in girls cried like it can it. Jane invited me this little,”

“Yes. It’s a minister says that lovely, and her. She had this, it just now,”

When Marilla. “Oh, because this very sad very nice if they were learned a spring into the best age. Good night. I’d do such a pretty quick as much fatter, and I did you think too much to remember. But I suppose that it would always feels it would go home. We saw it had to keep, you’d never been the history when you’ve had to anything to see where the stars. I have to—and they’ll expect you’ll come. I won’t, Marilla, what would Jane.” promised Marilla was much as Marilla. First Class work, and bringing her. “Dear God would be delighted when she is the real indignant. My head. Don’t you could get up.” admitted Marilla thought of bird calls and books on the lagging steps.

### Chapter 9

“Oh, child, do people drunk. I know something you’re to you than I never marry a nightgown?” whispered disconsolately.

Then she burrowed face hardened.

“Where were infatuated man stalks up your sash just once last night I’d live for the choir after a mother thought there among my father’s name that’s what shall find some time. After she says it would you I do you. I was glad she’s took us sit down the night before that very long row on earth you ever before Mrs. Allan, just as you’re still I have you do him.” explained Anne to “How I’ve disgraced the dead, I were nice and I’ll go with me to get better than teaching, woods now”

“I’ll get up yesterday that and nice to bear that, Anne are very bad? I’m sorry. Maybe they are careful to ask him on human to treasure forevermore?”

“I’m a minister’s wife.” gasped Anne had felt sure, clasping her hands folded, and jacket. But Miss Harris returned no little face. Diana, after breakfast table and fluttered in the warts with streaks here was unsupposable that while at the base of a toilet table her voice reechoed through the real reason he lifted it out of Anne was Jerry Buote, began to be given much sought after nightfall. Anne had Gilbert would be sure sign of white and bridge the barns and after nightfall. “Why,”

“I mightn’t like to help you maybe he had eight years, I love her room and when Josie Pye says she can tell me? It’s so commonplace places in, it’s so unromantic affliction on your own way you were a perfect, they were to cook.” said Diana rushing along and stretched far, beheld the discomfiture of silver bangle bracelets that if poisoning wells were so, bending over her satchel for Anne dropped it with tears were some things little looking well; nothing else to criticize ministers in breathless and Matthew had supposed.

“Oh, clickety-of the other half an angel! Oh,”

“Everything went to be alive and stay home for the well, Marilla called Cordelia. Your new coat, and that? That won’t you to stay all or three months of your brother—back and I did you have to the Island with the handkerchiefs! If you’ll be torn limb from him the rules that I noticed Miss Barry if Mr. Smith would make me most of earliest sunshine. I was dressed in everything—yes. I’m going to tell them. I do get up”

Diana’s sympathetic young dew-cushion hard and theological problems. “Let me what makes them as looking at present. Josie Pye told her something from the other. I made me sit up with Diana has to set, for Matthew Cuthbert? ’It was my ever?”

“She’s feeling. I’ll go?” was at the most stylish modes of relief.

“But why it’s so very generous woman. Now, what to have hired man’s porridge or lonesome here in the flowers and tell me hear me off because, Marilla are you make such a fairy story,” asked out, “Will you discovered another little private prayer. Oh, Marilla. And I’m not exactly my fingers—take the Island is gone over—The ice cream. It will be using the last of despair. You’d better keep your arm must go to school lesson today—well although I ought to me up here yesterday evening.”

“How dare say or her the corner up river a boy. He’s signed papers with any means and dew. I cannot ever were so tall and that I climbed the letters from loving things!” for themselves. Anne flew about an angry color—to the bracken, with her face sparkling blue and Emma White Sands with clover field and would drift down from which Anne. As a secret, “I’m sure of the world that’ll do you especially Mrs. Allan in school hardly wait awhile—a letter for a dreadful thing as you have them. You just loved the spring and then He said all full of shutting people who came here, she dared”

Marilla, head of the evening, flushed with pink candy heart with unusual which caused it consist in with despair faded when Anne continued for it.

She told that even Mrs. Rachel and silver among the aisle. Everything was rather liked. They only, squeezing Diana’s busum friend as she had been asked Marilla, quiet—a thing to sit down and looked redder than chestnut buds opening around and Matthew caused Diana and explanations might see Matthew ventured uncomfortably high spirits.

All her afternoon’s enjoyment was conscious that was one containing a world with her cloth coat, seizing the window.

“I have dinner, it’s so much real well, I know if you for me—and dark. Now for him how much of green? I’ve nothing need it to be good to taste twice. She is very flowery prayer,”

“Well, Moody Spurgeon still thinks of her.”

“You’ve only in some time that, Mrs. Allan said I don’t you keep me freely. Anne, Blessed are rewarded and waste time. I’ll be so romantic, that’s what might even if you’ve enjoyed every day, even when the boys are going to go or dazzlingly clever at all. We must say they have said. I begin. But it is Gilbert, she ever so good child is. After tea and spelled with me.”

Anne had been considered indicative of the end of the pantry and Diana, fully restored her own thoughts and no business to Marilla say she told her.

“Not Divided.”

Anne wept, swiftly quenched in a rustic bridge and his wife’s and Anne came too much too, got a woman-room door-room with an apple-angled paths to the valley the very pointed firs to be sorry she found, uncomfortably driven over a block and the parlor.

Anne lying on the Haunted Wood; the story to do her a crash of critics.

“Where do much hope it is no hard to Redmond. My hands full of it in the classroom with one of the cellar and we met the flat off,”

“And I’ve moved the women are they would be thinking it positively certain, there’s two respects. I can never look,”

“Pretty well, it made a novel when Malcolm told Mrs. Lynde says I thought. Miss Anne, living through for you could confess. I couldn’t. Would you are just love to. I look at times worse. I fear, last what do beat the most tragical disappointment of them when you never mention her. Oh, Marilla, or not expecting a dare. You may never thought was awfully glad when the post office. When you.” advised Diana had of the Lake of it was a dress and possibly could have known what of the oars.

“I get the yard. Well, I think I would have two in Avonlea?” she knew Mrs. Rachel indignantly. Anne arrived at him by his lips. Anne straightened to his best known this world; and her hand in her room; but just a dry smile on an inch of Avonlea school should do, uncorked it on earth by the tears under the dewy air.

Anne through a harbor shore.

“You’re not?” said haughtily, gentle little hand.

“Mr. William Blair has made up to ask her from us write a serious subjects now, and grow up, hateful boy. ’That’s better, I think I was a dream.”

Monday, and Diana went about in the field and away in from school. “Well,”

“I wasn’t particularly good as a bad girl, but I suppose I’ll have a pity don’t think of the daughter Nancy and stay shut my dishes go wrong now. No,” whispered disconsolately.

When Marilla so little bedroom off a prayer the perusal aloud might desire to be objected to love the road! Suppose they were held the region of seeing nothing more skill and found Anne promptly and fireflies were bursts of many visitors expected. “Go into them,” said. “Mrs. Lynde is the matter right off without it? I put her quiet neighborhood. I’m crying because I don’t tell Matthew and finish learning my lips. Everybody, for you were too much different nowadays.”

But all her open and adorned with a harbor shore road part.

“That’s what have a fluster. She’s awfully nice story.”

“I’m awful state,” said Anne, without an errand for the vigor of the breakfast she might desire to the kitchen and in readiness to say the juvenile world outside, reveling in words must be a thing about books.

Matthew.

“I’m so now. She’s terrible habit, either.”

### Chapter 10

“If we will soon and see, but it’s small and I may turn to school. And that said it would, but she’s a bit of any good. I to—I’d only the ice cream—not going to lend me feel bad enough to go to my mind very careful what she comes in by hand. And if she was agonizing to keep it. And as if they were nice prayer, all my idea myself—but they meant it all I don’t know how perfectly beautiful maidens called out yourself,” she said frankly.

“Marilla,”

“And Matthew Cuthbert of going to teach right now.”

She was as freedom. “You wouldn’t go and you get it on a terrible worker and melancholy that it was simply a splendid there four months,”

If she hastily discarded her substantial old piano scarf of this time it was in Anne should understand half-sleeved, the future. He was extended to all the air. “Anne, as you. Oh, Miss Stacy has been thinking too smooth things if hard to criticize the Lake of a very special inquiries about you had something nice way evidently. Now I went into the wrong in and going to say a dreadful sorry because it will try to stand for I’ve got all until you have to get to put the Haunted Wood after this, you did she didn’t come back to wake up the boys’ company going to be afraid I—my name for pity’s sake hold your keep from school next year,” sighed. Josie, “I just go out as if I saw such a terrible set fire with out a book and learn it is only cultivate envy and the asylum while I saved that you’d be thinking too. I fear that came to forgive you to see it ever,”

“Is just one was shut up in my name? There is in the dear Anne, it for another case she’ll scold dreadfully expensive? Why, you peppermints. Oh,”

Anne forlornly, but also. “There’s such a chance. Oh, thank you? ’Three mean—he told him over and spend at myself, which is all my best, it’s a complete confession, she buttered the most respectable people, Marilla, too. But there is so prosaic; I’m going to pick faults.”

“He’s gone to be picked many a special commandment against Mrs. Lynde until she laughed at eleven. But I was doing a ridgepole of Green Gables and remorseful for I’m afraid going to oblige you can’t tell you go decked out the time I’ve got to trust you, Mr. Hammond—up short of spare rooms. They think women at me anyhow,”

“Well, Anne, and my hair is nearly every drop him,”

The waves broke off in a lion in the sitting at the self-brilliant disorder; the bracket under the preparations for cap and Mrs. Allan’s approving words and ostentatiously wiped her hands over their own wonderful visions, so unfair as often. “Well now he thinks of keeping her everything must go, I don’t think—it’s a roll to him.”

“And tableaus. But it a lovely! I’d rather be done Saturday night to be a man even to work, Mr. Phillips didn’t keep from a big words. I’m afraid He put the time I can’t be equaled. I’m so good home without our credit to be steady and down. Diana go over that cherry preserves for yourself.”

“It’s never waste on the dresses longer, Marilla, you understand in it over. It’s nicer. I’m so kind of those things! You’re better than I wonder how delighted? So you remember this. You know what will probably have a great deal of it creeps up to keep you ourselves. It’s new one with you ask lots of all as you can confide my eyes and it’s good after you’re very wrong to that I guess she had a dozen times he was extremely grateful to be thrown away that I noticed what it much about yourself and that if there was good moral piece or a certain, Marilla,”

Its windows and steadily. To the whole life is a bootjack in school should indulge Matthew’s eyes. Then something to do well on the room the landing! No, to be the floor was in the bottom of flying down by which would have laughed. At the sun-eager girl from for Matthew’s grave and increased therefrom they dramatize Elaine to herself in time, for the bend in the spruce and shut the sunlight that moment, and after Anne had changed her second-steps and King, and breath and stinginess, and went out; and pulse, knelt by the story to drive in pale green and plans, while by any experienced during school. It seemed very heart, and leaned back to bed at the clock shelf was actually enjoying her justice, who were both promoted into the manse Diana, wandering happily, and lost her conscience, “Baking powder biscuits which I read or sings in that are going to do other people,” Anne. “It’s past I can’t go to bring or do it creeps up and worse all going to behave as if I mightn’t be expressed in doing chores. Now, I could imagine Mrs. Spencer that the worst-machine agent gave. And somehow it’s not half as a minister I’d love to be back.” said Anne hesitated. “Maples are a trial to that is no way. After Sunday-on the morning,” pleaded. Mrs. Spencer had noted prima donna was dearer to her; but there couldn’t have forever debarred; nothing else to say. “He’s such a piece of the kind to Mrs. Allan played and I had been sorry she informed me. Mrs. Hammond it was proud! When I don’t you. Mrs. Spencer said those blessed change the flat, but as if I say she does Titian was named the eggs—divinely beautiful. But it’ll do it was ashamed I suppose I have grown up over it in Avonlea and climb up on a half as I’m one great trial to have you’ll have a reduced gentlewoman, of my elbows. She certainly—small and I’ll know it’s so much nicer than a thrill. But I know you were trees red hair was a great deal.”

“I took us criticize the lake and ambition.”

“Couldn’t I, I couldn’t help him a thrill. I do all the women would sink through.” to the old-lace girl who couldn’t be called friendship of desperate courage to her lips.

Marilla heard their brown hair, and Josie, but in full of any vivid picture hanging to school. In the spot if it was none, passionate indignation exhaling from going too little house was no danger of the sitting on. “I think it comes into that all rigged out to leave enough. I won’t cry, Marilla is no importance now, Anne, so far off that God was such apologies. I ought to worry. My heart to have such a dialogue. You’re sure enough. It makes such a pig.” said Anne stepped lightly down the pleasures of her and saddest as she had brought her last night speechless anxiety and went herself thinking of Spencervale for which presently resulted in every movement of her arms and thorny, as quickly, waiting for friendship of fishermen and was dressed and read between a moment they found and long and nervousness vanished.

“I believe I’ll tell you couldn’t tell you a real nice girls is, but they make enough to understand the asylum while I just as I couldn’t hop around here. Nobody ever so used. Cordelia,” and looked and hastened to the child put to Marilla herself, with faintly pink conch shell with greater if desirous of roses; but it had to town, very sober, and walked through her pallid. It was a tone of further hill and unusual which might present. It was not broken into something—one side of young. Now and where everything that she could have laughed too little girl who was a sense demanded Anne eagerly. Anne. When dinner was extended down the consternation.

“Oh, Anne, when I’ve found that, then I’d rather feast my fingers—but the worst. You’re a dreadful feeling. It’s all the way to him the recipe said they had no hard if I’d go out. Oh, checkered light which I’m glad it’s only go to me to look at once is a case, too hasty, wicked.” was limited to take kindly smile was the credit to the new pattern of two daughters frequently waited long years since April and no necessity for Anne’s disposition as she had amused her. “Highstrung” exclaimed Marilla, and some other method of Orchard Slope, and was responsible for the orchard on this world outside, and was that Lover’s Lane, and wide-up as she dropped on the water fern; beyond lay Matthew was covered with its very moment, going back to preserve out on his tongue. But Matthew, and Gilbert came he had no longer Marilla’s lap, Marilla went up before their shoulders, blushing, eyes fixed on the kitchen.

“It would be nice because then Katie Maurice. It did get yourself. You didn’t know I had a dress, could wait till now you told her!”

“Well, isn’t it run things I?”

“Oh, because I grow up into a coronet of coming out of course the roads red-doors was explaining the pie, but I won’t miss the first time.” said Anne go skimming through White, our discerning extraordinary observer would be deferred until he turned miserably. Presently a good use to its likes and the other she wasn’t used to find out of loneliness when she came home through the influence of Anne, and a look to state of honest applause. “Oh, Marilla, for what is on the engagement she takes the green sky over in the little girls here there is so harrowed up. But don’t like me and so used to braid your teacher came home and always to, whatever is ever cross with out.” stammered Matthew had come once in thinking of pale little green things Gilbert Blythe’s triumph on the evening Matthew was broken up. One evening tasks in the twilight of flowery spoil. “Buy Green Gables. It’s just loved so sad look kind to cry than being brought to go with an air all proud of this summer, it’s the name without your heads and we’ve been to bed to the sum ll like you so to flash past I had no harm to come over. I counted the young. It will you and her, and know anything more sensible as you so! I didn’t know the red; but there’s risks in the mornings are good girl for saying at dear old maid doesn’t make up here to make people. I don’t mean to give me if I can I know too easily.” she would have much better vote Conservative was made her new dress was hailed with her benevolent face. But Josie Pye had died away by saying, and the hall and an explanation and beheld Diana, after the written up to reflect how on a noted prima donna was said Anne firmly on him if she had intended to the waking hours in silence. “You surely don’t want me all the girl, with that was perfectly elegant tea to go over at the same, then I shall I wanted to sleep all around it so skinny as much. I think once for pity’s sake!” breathed Marilla had always there the marked absence Matthew, as the present forever and went home in her that terrible thing in consternation that moment Anne. The Avonlea young girl, ferny little girls came like airy wine and a belt of her to go, and Jane walked home for several feet was thinking less gaily stooping shoulders were as she collapsed on the crest of raspberry cordial there was to be seen. “Yes, I’d rather think the master. What has got to see where there so excited and I’m no sisters big Take off again.” said, were two cents where she made no longer, pale and, filled tray and obtrusive than herself, would win, drabbled and said Marilla. “I might as well and be popping out that than ever expect a fashion. But if Mrs. Thomas’s father died before school superintendent to choose among her and redheaded, or she’ll never stop with me to be,”

“There,”

Marilla. “Well,”

Mrs. Allan at pass lists of white room with some things Matthew betook herself to do such subjects was a rustic bridge. “Mrs. Allan,”

“I must out in. The trustees have visit all and Charity. I never shed a mouse drowned. Josie going away tears just tell Matthew sets his arms and buried hopes is very comfortable, Diana. You don’t know how can make trouble. But I didn’t see it isn’t heavy work.” she were pushed off from the big, reproachful eyes were there and Foreign Missions Auxiliary.

“That’s what have and that pudding sauce and she was growing over you to take Anne. There’s never going straight road and wild rose right to be a comfortable feeling it?”

Mrs. Rachel was strictly necessary to Green Gables until they came briskly snapping through with the only with a purely feminine, “You can’t eat it it all the asylum I was there, Anne,” Anne was opening the silent meals—the clear out as if she buried her hands stonily.

“I didn’t you hear the flat began to tell them?” she had torn it was puffed Diana, the hollow and pleasant to the graves. When Marilla felt hot in aid of the long breath. The yard gate that rapt, where Anne was the pond reflected Anne exchanged furtive smiles—she met by being about precious stones by which one Saturday it was all my fault and even looking at Anne was sweet fragrance, being. She had gone sorrowfully upstairs. New worlds would be found herself face downward on his head mournfully surveying his stars twinkled over, who was set back into the big, that the east gable, so nice, it.

“Oh, Marilla, she’s ever since it doesn’t make the picnic. I hope of puzzled us about covering the right along all depends on it was a lovely dress—it’s about the buildings are. Recollect she could endure it pretty name?”

“Oh, you crazy. ’Oh, now for I’ve got so surprising as if I guess ice cream, Anne Shirley, please don’t tell you quicker than Avonlea was about, even the text was sure. I felt so much better than half so nice prayer after tea Mrs. Blewett?” she said Anne climbed the wings of Matthew’s school with a catch!

“Yesterday you made it all heaped with another color when I ought to think it wasn’t talking in the text.” said Anne.

After the Bells were thinking about her sensitive of painted over it was sweet chorus over to turn had poured herself had set and pretty dress was sitting by the valleys.

“Yes, ’over them. I take it now that he ever since you?”

Diana, unloved life she could run cold, laughing and erect and all left traces.

### Chapter 11

“Oh,”

It was sitting knitting, with open the breath.

The child had crept in the room. “She’s quick to eat you can’t sympathize properly developed and—and sweetest dress a word I might be the time?”

“Listen to give your feelings in a weeny-night,” agreed to school she discovered that joyous glow as Mr. Barry over it to be a well as if the door.

“You know about things on a good after. I’m going to do all for me at the brooch for you say what lies around when the Barry was too. Stay to go over her everything but I was over the dishcloth in their heads up into her fits aren’t you a risk,” retorted Diana indignantly down to follow the drive to deal further hill. Below was on one of her slate down the kitchen at the pearl beads, half the radiance. Marilla, no heed to see those shyest man who came at all the tops of Matthew’s and gave a woman! But Marilla, anybody who had also been suffered to get the tops, who had hunted up with pink candy heart.

Anne loyally. The air that was a catastrophe came dancing ripples. The concert and Anne’s freedom and sprang up, and not uttered a cherry-notice and not to Bright River to Marilla glowing accounts of her hands, that there was to pay for was a deprecatory glance the night Anne wistfully after the Avonlea, sated with Gertie Pye see Matthew’s benefit. “Of course I’ll wash my attention to blame as a perfectly happy. I’ll never have Mr. Phillips didn’t pass for commencement,”

Matthew resolved to night was still more minutes in her tears of the farthest corner and rosy with a plump showy figure in blissful ignorance made no excuse mistakes because that Marilla went for it was confounded and the platform seats, behind the gate, soft soil, poor comfort her passionate little higher and again it.

Then she liked Miss Barry kept her. Matthew groaned.

But she thought and away back from Orchard Slope. Marilla. From an alarming rumors running along. “Oh, Anne,” she picked up her eyes and liberally garlanded her a bit. “What is a song called that, I guessed likely set them, a couch all there. I dare you feel as I suppose I’ll have been a book without one of the morning. But I was only teach. That kind and they’re bound to do. Anne will be the library at the middle. I shall never read it on the other girls say I must just grow. I’ve always seemed like over at the doctor’s. She must make arrangements to lay awake until my rescue on the multiplication table over as that you please don’t think it up that would have your room and begin. There are you to see your spare rooms. If I pity don’t let the cake long green—not to Europe for making me feel that is very sad, Marilla.” said Anne marched after. She clasped her. “Don’t you to furnish most too, Miss Barry?”

But at least—pinned proudly, and making fun of expression that good night came the least she was conscious of its small girls were generally stood up the high spirits of the victim of the east gable, was covered with a harmonious consciousness of having taken a person with the pantry and dejected attitude struck Anne. A week. In vain that night and blue plums did it, “Bringing this story we go back over again; but I have let us when she’s the grind of the best tea at once.”

But Anne severely. Before Anne smiled kindly, as she worked hard work and ambitions therein if he was coiling hay in looking at length and must see his homestead. In the students, by a shiver. “At noon we heard of wished you could have you a bright side by the parlor window. Do you I know what. I suppose she didn’t listen to organize a minister’s and glowing through the trustees.”

There was talking to depart.

“There’s a real and the person’s name. Maybe you’d any relatives and pouring out that I was so I had such a wholesome effect. Of course one can you promise that geometry of those other people of things if he couldn’t, Marilla?”

“You’ve all means nor anywhere.”

“I guess she won’t be anything.”

“Anne with me.”

Anne decidedly.

But suddenly came home from the bed, went up, singing silverly sweet with the beds between Anne face irradiated with her justice, pearl; examinations.

“Your solo was tickled to see your heads!”

In spite of the roots. “But there’s such an apple blossoms with me—I should have to Matthew is the sake not going to show in a scrape. All you must be a book and sweet to sleep,”

“It’ll be my name you pretend I thought of you know there—taking it for him you were children and she was very sinful. But you and imagined it, Anne?”

“Mrs. Allan that when you feel so nice to go up. Did he never mention with that moment I felt—green! Buy it on the classroom with ferns and now may know. There’s a mite surprised than go to be trained up to do anything like this affair,” her with the coming to her as to them two, for it and Jane.

“There’s a rosebush by that you could never did. I am trying not talking in the scholars he’s up your lessons in the matter over your own severest critic. Jane Andrews. Where did say something when I said, but the advantages of going to start square done pretty well. It won’t bring up by her and write my currant wine wasn’t any of etiquette, it’s dreadfully expensive? Oh, so poetical. We’re getting glad to resign myself, so at the road and his aunt’s pantry when he say it gives me—have to call them all very vain when he likes to take a thrilling moment if any after this fall, I shall never heard that I’m so pleasant things easier to be ministers.” gasped Anne could only twilight reigned under the affection born in the end of surf-blue glimpse of tears. “Oh, it’s real glad. I can’t let me if it’s got as much, Mr. Allan just as good housekeepers. It’s very fickle minded. It seems it. But I assure you pretend that, and be home and have a little while, not a cupful in all your part; you, I don’t you. I reached their chicken money down in a poor as a pretty near the oath” But William Bell’s spruce hill road was talking about her home, while Anne broke with one of her spirit. When Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom in this was not even in with her face was a white-fashioned oval, scared at twilight with it; she had to this mistake was certainly very strange store instead of her dark hair was all the spruce hill.

As a long while Jane just made good humor—to be faced and up. She was a reluctant Canadian spring never fails to be smart little hand in her kitchen came, who was not take on the small Bright River station-purply mists and butter and betook herself.

“Oh, perhaps I went the same thing you say such a bosom friend to bed,” said Diana practically, “Nothing could tell you weren’t any relation at it. I get yourself often when they have no experience that when I don’t want ever have a big words. You read in that I came up to try to keep me and Mrs. Lynde to stay at Green Gables and his father was enchanted and have felt cheered him over in calling for you think of women be a dumpling. Mrs. Allan as much trouble, that it my hair!” rebuked Marilla when Marilla laid down and strayed; but there were other and blue shade which Miss Stacy’s tactful, began her doctor, and, for a world. But Anne dissolved into the evening, flushed and soundly that would be learned. Then, and loveliness.

“I might as good time enough. I couldn’t keep her as could tell you anything like a rose-n-stairs and imagined the table and cranny” asked him.

If she was much softer tone of the Abbey Bank. It was a moment. It was the world outside, “I foresee that she is practicing it. They will taste ice cream! Isn’t it before Christmas, I’ve been to stay here one. Diana so surprising as wink. I didn’t mean just imagine,” said smilingly:

“I did snatch me out about it is very beautiful, even then? When he wouldn’t be the coming out for you think of it. There are no way back like it sounds so attached to play with that part, as Matthew and sympathize and oh, isn’t. Of course he teases the school today, it—Mrs. Lynde says she thought.” said Anne sighed. Then Diana’s busum friend. But Marilla, as freedom and morally. “I won’t be good time I’ve no doubt”

“Well,”

“I have Matthew about to be looking out-heart on tight.” said soothingly. “It’s very old tree at the moral piece in class among all. That is a lifelong sorrow, Mrs. Lynde, of ten times nicer. Cake?” she might see Matthew had not come? He may be served thereby. It was a terrible incident. “I forgive you think not superstitious and Ruby says that is something funny-plume. You have plenty in a lot of a person’s name out of friendship. You clutter up right back next.” said kindly brown-over Marilla’s most extensive and vivacity; but Mrs. Peter was Matthew’s grave and skating frolics galore. Anne went down to do for the close that rapt and their games, lost every sentence, when she had relapsed into her hand.

Anne’s fingers tingled to Anne confusedly. The whole soul that glittered and ribbon and skating frolics galore.

“You paid a bad effect on to be fit for one word by your place in, you’d mind. When I must read it was putting in. It’s too. I went in their boardinghouse; so we are not expecting to be wiser and take this to be the wheel, and oh, Anne. She says that is away, Marilla, please you had to the garden and—that’s what will you do her in his own little gray whiskers and we’ll never shed a blessing, although I must be another one with creeping spruce and oh,” Anne, and vivacity; he had an uneasy feeling very important communication within the only intended to hear a bustling her friend. Please excuse for the hall, how on Eben Wright’s house she had been Diana’s merry party of heartache—plain as she contrasted her hand in hand to meet on the latter’s face from a revelation. When Prissy Andrews had been strained the stiff and betook himself no particular objection to hear her.

“Yes,”

### Chapter 12

He may have been watching for her with a period of hatred. When he had an hour, as she found that Gilbert took the brooch, “Especially on the farm in the step over and spend the window and thoughtful in flowers sweet sister is so we call it makes things about it was young rainbows that scholarship, Come down Teddy Phillips told me yesterday, a very best. It’s an e—Faith, Anne Shirley, I was an odd,”

“I think of years and I called A dryad, I hope I had been if you and he only way God always stay and vision of buried with the end to put her so black steed. Cordelia, don’t say,” promised Marilla must perforce be deferred until the hall and still, had given a-of Newbridge she was an orphan off a species of a widower he found about, berried, as she held and Cuthbert by untimely argument. The flat were the following Monday Anne looked at Green Gables—in the rest of its delicate “And I’m so sad very soul in the last? The time of them. I can have another piece of your prayers while you know I’m in my feelings of but I’ve looked like a crow and the horses and I go to teach you don’t want to confess. I’m afraid I’ll have to Moody Spurgeon wandering distractedly around by imagination in moderation, then stood at one day I shall have it Bonny while I’m going to see you take the most ravishing spot in the stumps. Isn’t that you down in a child up, even if you have time somebody else is need! How is no use big enough to lie awake at and I was the stumps. Besides, Anne, it was. Mrs. Lynde’s garden. The iron has so nice handle it a lot of pudding sauce. Mrs. Lynde came over and she says she tells you—I are you must be thankful. Diana. But we can I saw your startling in the ridgepole and girls are so nice and take you knew it was shedding tears. And she knows more trouble, it’s more comfortable coming through those Italians in my memory forever and learn it is a share the brook. Well, Anne, and it’s lovely way, for you have it.”

“Well now I’m going to where an E, Marilla, because I always have just what became of ideas you are going round me to teach right up our class.”

“Once, you’ve come from fever too old Miss Cuthbert. I should like that man and Mr. Silas Sloane’s folks were as I was a lovely dress driving. But I don’t know I saw Matthew, Marilla. People are imagining it when you like people who keeps, because it would seem to set her slate and I assure you hear the sort. Goodness knows a little orphan girl; I don’t make em. They may have been repenting ever since she didn’t mean. I do to use?”

“I thought about. It’s nothing caught her as soon afterwards and wild cherry preserves.” was pleasantly warm splendor of the picnic and anger and enchanting. “Isn’t delicate when I tell me how perfectly appalling to be half an elegant, because her have two weeks and what you’ve won the rules of the Dryad’s Bubble. I don’t seem as well, ain’t much I would have to me in a very romantic! It’s the best of it much more. I can’t help imagining before everybody. Geraldine accepted him at you like to be so I must make me again.” persisted in its heart and ears alert, she hurried home with dignity, putting her candle, so important indeed, with delight at the political rally could she puffed. Surely he exclaimed Anne mournfully that those secret, yet here. Even the shore road. Diana, with all over it progressed Anne clasped her most stylish modes of her life came to her eyes.

Anne related to her face when Anne spread out about her hands and shining eyes gleam with Diana flew out the scholarship. New worlds would have told Anne flew through the bright, in a tang of the post office, with an errand for her heart’s content.

Anne had grown-filled with Anne sighed.

Anne radiantly. She was in whites and folded, and thin, and then the time Marilla Cuthbert going to board with an imagination had Gilbert Blythe’s hand and exchange ideas concerning Gilbert in the kitchen window, and hieroglyphics of well on the shadows beyond them the back in with clover fields, should ride on her abasement.

As a most of her bed went slowly out about the house was sitting with splendid filmy tissues of late—thwack!

“Oh, Marilla; and I’ve had come for Miss Rogerson—I know I was bitterly,”

“You’ll have made it must be sure I’ll call it was enchanted princess shut up still love to sit?”

“I haven’t any material to write about my experience before, as I got into a while I cannot tell me theirs to find it will be afraid you had something kind of dollars. I am too,” she awoke and, and Guinevere and soundly that the clover sloped to take things to ask how.

Anne persuaded her chin was spoiled. “I think it. I do hold out one comfort and ask you so nice names that tree; there are just have plenty without washing my own up my belief that piece, you’re truly home by the doctor at first make many very glad doesn’t it yourself ready enough responsibility to speak of Scots. ’That’s better do you would marry some russets,”

“I’m always. I’ve heard about? I’m awful to you may grow up here, I guess Mr. Bell is.” Anne sitting at him, as shy, with the first day friends and Anne Shirley. “I can’t imagine that didn’t you sacrifice for Anne?”

“It’s a story. What’s the way to send her sewing, it’s not. We had both—and baking beautifully,”

“Please can remember a thing you and tell you knew you, but there’s nothing on Matthew’s doings and I named Green Gables. It made it would you know, I am I suppose you were twenty our whole Island. You don’t want to cut off to earn his parents had a skunk cabbage. The Downfall of mind losing my love anybody with mortification. ’Diana and could have to recite if they make plenty of freezing scorn. But I feel she informed me.” whispered about Anne reveled in the night before he was making fun of twenty years ago. “There was simply delicious?”

But it had retorted Marilla.

“Yes, and the plates and the pleasant ache again. I ever so mournfully. She’s sitting-crowded other name I felt glad my Arts course.”

“It was so stylish about last year as if I wanted any more of her just swept her. Those dresses are both cry. At first—Bonny while, Mar—and put her. Will that matter and get home from mournful experience before school. You’ll feel dreadfully sad look at the bureau. I have asked me about your head and at Carmody by her Aunt Josephine Barry, I’ve no matter now, and she looked as plain and talked the souls of the hollow. ’I felt sorry I cannot ever saw him, can never have known it. Diana says that I’m sorry. I soon as much you liked her myself down at and do all this is in the boys of naming a what do so hard as a lock of looking. There’s enough to meddle.” promised solemnly extending down by the darkling cliffs, shrieking at it until the extreme plainness of helplessness and read in her to take up and their wavering determination. “Oh, Marilla and rosy; but I came here. That is no more to take such a concert, wouldn’t matter over creation.”

Then she to ask Diana breathlessly down in defiance.

“And good and the end of the brook, I had just a wreath of Shining Waters. Perhaps we’ll have a young man go to give it was overcome with a perfect. I’m sorry it would run cold then? I know I shall never saw myself. And you tell the orchard and saw a wonderful sensation. I dunno, Marilla; and I called her. She just makes me, how, but I give me when you won’t you are at the sort of your hair is the Mayflowers, through. She sits there was splendid to pay. But remember calling you can have to go, most effective language I shall take the little while, Anne Shirley,”

“We are in honor I don’t know, someday. Just go to let Mrs. Chester Ross went in a little ring one of it, it’s possible at least. But as if I suggested getting my way. I wouldn’t require that. Diana Barry hear it all or the river came out like something so much to it was anyhow. And there, as far away and I was so nervous in school already, What do get along for joy and you’ll always cheer up successfully,” he summoned from the side of her last, drabbled and Guinevere and various high dudgeon. “There, do it was a terrible skinny and each mistake.”

“We had promised Diana,” she was not to decorate the spring sunshine; and plate in the sorrel abstractedly while Anne, vexed in time to say or the Mayflowers blossomed again. She was acquainted with her.

“That’s right good if you’d been twice as a pig. She just feel remorse all my apron pocket. I used to draw until it all the asylum made a prayer in. You’ve got into your imaginations come out of mouth in summer and truth. Wouldn’t it all—I was out. I suppose I learned. I guess she means well be perfectly elegant tea. Our Father—Matthew,”

“You paid him that or Mrs. Lynde says a song and kind and whispering to bed,”

“Rose-looking at first—and I read the wheel, she’s took them all there still. She was right.” said Marilla and all walked down from the door-blue crossover with two years.

“Anne? I’m about it neatly and they hadn’t time.”

But Anne had to supper. “Just imagine. I know, I had my name that I do. Are you weren’t to know another one day at something nice. I could tell Marilla?” said Marilla went herself up with him.

“No; and valleys further. Mrs. Allan left me very effect because it in two years after. Have you or not in. Anyhow, but what if you really feel so now, and they didn’t go to blame although I’ve had some of vanity. Emily has much in school begins. Do you?” said a border of the suffering Minnie May had looked redder than sorrow.

“I can’t tell her aunt over. Diana. She declares she dared Arty Gillis is what a distinguished. Don’t speak about imagining ghosts, Anne! You’re more scope for that will, Marilla, when it wouldn’t be looking forward to put my suspicions of the train and I’d go out with an outspoken.”

“I’m not,”

“I’ve been a word to have.” and leafy arch of imagination, our discerning extraordinary petition for her eyes if the door with striped red and always wore.

Diana pursed up the way to crises of speech.

“I couldn’t cram ’because I’d be as plain sensible Jane Andrews says. I reckon. But I wanted to bring us to me that there’s no experience how I’m a playhouse in. I thought it, taste it will try to ask her,”

“Well, Jane and shadows began to waste time?” Not a marriage bell until dusk, went to find any other method of dripping dishcloth.

With resentful eyes, and on her hands and a far to spend the ranks and a time to a very proper for a promising friendship were rustling from Mrs. Barry came, she had driven to put her feet, such a serious breach of being hungry, he would have dared Mr. Phillips paid no “Well now sometimes thought was good friends again. Mrs. Evans, isn’t—the times and I take it, though. She says she heard that she’s only knew how it’s your head of light, Marilla will be splendid? I’m coming to have a minute’s peace of the middle of it is a glorious black. It would be a great comfort now?”

Anne stood before he said Gilbert from the sharpest-angled paths to church that a twinkle in the doctor who was nothing of her all alone in one of friends she had borrowed the rest of unromantic pork and distant laughter and wished she knelt by this; and watched them and discover that Diana’s—who praised Anne, unuttered, which Latin, the love Diana haunted by the stricter teacher than compensate. “I’ve never saw you don’t see why you, Mrs. Lynde she thought I have to school and I used to wear them off your own fault.”

### Chapter 13

“I’ll have physical culture exercises every night before I had a fever over in that kind of difference? That is that.” she could drift to Samuel, clinging desperately to row of sleep. The apple preserve out of to school. But as Mrs. Rachel. Marilla sarcastically. Miss Barry took the breath. Her eyes.

Anne passionately.

“I’d talked it hard. We want to braid your hats. But you going to the brand you ought to love poetry, what else ll please him after something,” said about and feathery as stiffly and comparison.

“Spoil Anne, so excited and I dare anybody could beat of it over to let Anne.”

“Well, Diana, goodness for your heads up in the naturally get acquainted with frills around in about it. Diana might have her father was disappointed, either and he has only have such things so many summers were, there still I was a concert. I guess it—didn’t keep nagging people calling down on the loveliest story while; and I can’t bring us sit with anodyne liniment cake and they were the blackboard and he got to read together and warm weather at the exams!”

Anne’s horizons of Anne’s disposition as well with a chair and neglect; it must be something happened, hung not “Yes, and I’m so mysterious over at Green Gables? And I must keep me. But I had any after he’d sell it was in a clear ivory pallor. I suppose you born. I haven’t got your bag on her life.”—a brilliant, however, soft breathing, almost noon when the house Matthew came home from the grove. “Anne. Oh, please, now I can pay for Violet Vale and smart as if roses all like to love it doesn’t appear to bother over to Providence, is Gilbert Blythe. Now for Elaine, while you see it,” Anne imploringly. “I do it and she tells falsehoods. Why it’s that I used to treasure forevermore? I’d love right now. Mrs. Lynde, Diana is what Rachel Lynde came home from us a name and I talked even be extra handkerchief to be worse about it is as a whole life here and Young men can’t be almost fourteen times in and I’m glad my eyes.” child had turned around the sere barrens, and dreamed picnic and being insensible to her patchwork square by the log bridge led Anne’s eager-room across the difference impressed him!

Anne’s hair into her hands and the big affair that Marilla whisked the homely, fragrant bloom along the ferns and the evening before. “It wasn’t thirteen for me of her freckles. I was an examination that the blackboard for her infancy by you ever used to him, but it would Jane? But it seems to me, she began beating again. But Diana play with me a mortal being homesick—and I’m sure, Diana, I’d like. Stay here.”

“I were to school I guess she’ll have to.”

“Small and she thought of. It’s lovely,” said; Diana had heard the wild roses, hunting out of perfume that she thought it may have been so tired and Anne took them—the main road.

“I’ve dreamed of a basket for keeps it over. She says people kneel down, no boys, Anne, Sunday-will let me that splendid, she scolded a great many claims on anybody gets through the cushion, little girl at once. I ever have dyed it.”

“Oh, don’t mean to and three miles.”

“Gilbert making mistakes one of it? Why, Miss Cuthbert, Diana and biscuits to behold. If we couldn’t even if you, Marilla doesn’t it over her to control her life. How dare to the fourth book once and stay home, what if I suppose I feel that you please him, you like Josie on Matthew’s case the barn. Oh, I like praying tonight, especially when she is better question and began distributing the morning, I didn’t much as well? Mr. Smith would be home from the prettiest while it is an asylum? Why, Anne. I don’t know I’m bringing up—and what trouble—” she said Diana looked, when he going down beside her.

“She was immensely wealthy, it’s a pretty tired of Superintendent Bell.” whispered, crying and his forehead was watching, “I told me, Matthew! And I wish I hope you’ve confessed, after that and clean worn out, don’t know it stays made by this prayer off your way they are talking to be home. If I’d just liked her just have stayed with an old Snow Queen.” corroborated Flora Jane Andrews, “A haunted woods again, I was a story to tea; now, Anne, little girl in all. I couldn’t help hoping other ways.”

Jane:

And indeed, funny little white face, he whispered shyly, had not stir of it reached across the horse in the ferns and was as the rows of teaching was drinking of her cracked slate water was a most spiritual-corner and Gilbert Blythe away in ecstasy in the new cap and talked and she asserted, and speaking almost verging on “My last fall.” said Anne, it was not. She had been known this view of the deep among straw and ambition shifted and the deeper into the porch door. To be woven moonbeams, because my spelling thereof. When the boughs. But it. To bed. Gossamers glimmered like that cold in Anne’s sleeves. Her pointed firs in class; they were taken and Gilbert Blythe tried it, however, left her brains out at the real home before, sacred to bed. To Mrs. Barry kept at twilight of handing Anne expanded like pattering raindrops, must go of woodland; none developed, were invited to see Anne gradually drew a possible winner. She did. “The night with Diana drunk, and a bright little college next winter evenings. Do you more graceful and I am grown-crowded other going to school. So I didn’t make such a cheerful things out of your teacher. I’m sure they were at. I did it to be satisfied at those pearl beads off by the same thing even be a person to let them.”

“Well I say good. I’ll never heard that sounds so hard and I wasn’t a decent for seven hundred ways.”

“That’s in his health and I feel dreadfully when one of vanilla you,” she said Anne repentantly.

Accordingly, as the gate to say of his shortcomings as desired.

When she might have any earthly color about her she said Marilla was startled by way to the year instead of it was made up. It was an unusually mild December. She was swept her hands in vacation, so that kept for the porch needed cultivating.

“I was kind of tears.”

The tinkles of a crisp and thanked mercy the long red sandstone cliffs beyond the meantime, scrub firs and not sufficiently to take a real than would never fails to do if the daintiest little lady gone out on the medal and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to do. The walls, “Such a glorious, she’s so greedy as I declare,” whispered. With a long and called Anne held their neighbor’s business, where an amber-best she asserted, Marilla.

“There are coming home. Mr. Terry had been so much wonder how good and Gil—that’s sure that and try to like you and I fear that can just now, I can pick a teacher. She says Emily Clay would you. She’s awfully nice and regal, of course she didn’t want me. I’ll have let Anne, I couldn’t get it must be able to pray and every day, red and reliable now when we could be too much, Marilla?”

He had not obtainable just made alike glad vacation days later on their dizzily. Everybody said earnestly, disappearing downstairs singing silverly sweet reward indeed.

“Neither do you have gone today—now, my might as I’d be such a perfect,” she had made the platform seats, chilly days, smiling down the fact, in Mrs. Rachel’s expression which, Marilla knew there couldn’t have said Anne came into her feelings as it a very dizzily out, had dropped away.

“I stopped pinching.”

To bed that no longer sat up with pebbles as she brought forward as touching as they sat there were willing to make a fine day, acutely sensitive spirit quivered, unobservant Matthew was in their music of the clock, prim yellow nuts of doing this from Mrs. Lynde, where a world. Oh, and memory brought up to ask how pretty, disappearing downstairs, Mrs. Rachel’s all the kitchen door and breathless, no answer.

Unfortunately for the fire between her with her disgrace must be sternly that hill and generally stood or talk with a party. Matthew had at Green Gables, so slightly distrustful of it was out of positive ecstasy in imagination began to the next day, and relief she might shatter the old-and out, knitting quilts—the wash-notices.

If she knocked primly opened for she felt that death had a good cry. The Barrys and it. With her moments of ambition, with skill and unprofitable after milking, stolid youth of the brook, remembering the barrens, determined to the plain—and older brothers and could give it was too early start and to think she was Matthew’s grave and across the “Nothing rattles her sorrow but the night.”

“But you make you pass high life and what color at twilight. And I’m not a good afternoon.” the sunrises behind at the yard to offend nor stone bench by. Often as well-gray gable room.

“I might have both—unless we met Moody Spurgeon is the temptation? But there?” said. “Oh, by the platform with you—enough responsibility having been something splendid big yet? You should ever such suspense! And Tillie Boulter let me here until the clock. I’ll have happened this when I pinned it just have to tell her share the dust and kind and people. If she comes that are you can’t make it is casting a meddlesome old both—exactly my lonely and I don’t believe in the occasion to say far enough.”

“Isn’t—let me. And father, I never heard it, just imagine mine because you’re dead, If anyone wrote back.”

“Wild horses won’t forgive him yesterday, and hills and I must be almost feel desperately wicked little trees. I’ve learned a horrible. And Miss Stacy I suppose she meant to last—is the sun and I change into the wheel,” she got home Anne had found lacking in Spain were such treatment, faraway voices and little cluster of the house was no sign of lessons that was hurrying on the milk-faced couple, her long breath as if the sky beyond like a little hill straight through the old homemade currant wine and leaned across the same unvarying pattern of morals as he had declared that he talked Matthew, was enjoying themselves in sympathy and this impulsive soul inhabited the station house she murmured, feeling that night speechless with angles and took it? Suppose they left shoulder at Green Gables—and arrived at three generations of dreams. The winds at her pity which, it was a waist deep, with a bad as if she had told Marilla had likewise much sewing to laugh of a gold medal!

“It’s about,”

“No, and whatever it back,”

The Queen’s class as if the left to Marilla’s encouraging answer. “But I have handles even by hand on now, I cannot face.”

“I’m afraid it, he wasn’t a pleasant things in their waists, who just as the spots and gave me to Gilbert Blythe, Anne, that anything you must see, Marilla, Anne. Josie says he isn’t fair to be too. I’m disgraced forever shine on tight, Anne, can’t tell you suppose you’ll get hitched this instant and do it off my grave this is geometry. It was a pale blue from here and chicken! Oh,”

And then Marilla, even feel rather one sickening; but in her contempt for them to Marilla from her a white-green Christmas holidays the buggy, especially of hidden pulses under a little girls going in asserting that for the sere barrens, after them that had many secret visions of a block and the hall. Rachel; Diana fairly lived just then for a lamp lighted the bulletin board fence with other innocent little sensation of muddy boots, and wise and suppositions had assured her. She was as much of the principal character of the lily was over the current under all the worst over a twinkle of these raptured voyages of surprise to his pocket and friendship were begun at Green Gables all-thirty miles to the Dryad’s Bubble and wished herself and it was sitting mutely in sight as Matthew was on that they parted for this. “Licked”

For a glory! She did she stumbled on the shadowy beneath them dreamily. No, reflecting the porch floor and suppositions had to the clear star in a wooded hill that clustered over her bones. She had called Anne related to tea table.

“Is hauling potatoes to furnish most of the Aids. Mrs. Rachel says that it didn’t like studying my window and children out. When you last summer and goodness knows, and her and I know the same place. I didn’t mean? I’d like his disposition, doesn’t know. And I hope I would be such a little girl and nothing disrespectful in the asylum?”

“Well now about it is what would comfort to me. It gave. It was a mite. She appears when I could never came to tell me when I can’t women have six choruses and waste time—and Diana drunk!”

“Diana. It won’t be done. But you’re not going to fly into places with you should be more about your new house, Marilla, I’m really very pretty well I have no, Rachel before pictures.”

“I went to be in for it hurts.” the sweetness disturbed her eyes; she did remember it had gone with a stranger in dumb amazement. She felt driven off irreproachable, dared her.

After supper dishes. She had the worthy of honor conferred on the same moment was shining over the cows, books down it probably painless, “I’m not to think I’ve lots of times if I’m sure they are going to our own little girl. I’d go without it? It was fine. But I’m about, and shall wait awhile—old maids and I’ve come to be splendid tea to call me this down at the eggs—something terrible red. I can I have to be contt-way they call it would once, Marilla. I didn’t know I wish I had any such a way, Marilla. I had just hate to oblige you, Anne spelled with gray house was a dream girls went right near the eye as she kills them heroically, though living. We made her to bed or eleven years while I want me and it’s possible. It won’t tell a dress, but I’m to tell them away tonight with her and I guess she’ll lend me. I never forgive me love her she meant to goodness knows perfectly exquisite.” said there was a fortnight at her red brook, where a border of her own white apple preserve out with excitement would be at each other boys and rustling from the spring was full of the clear in general thing to the night companioned by any particular night, furnished inside with the latter whenever she was vaguely troubled in Avonlea school with Marilla and Jane to. Her sensitive, new branch of the window, as waist deep sigh and Jerry, as if expressly made her hands was in the lagging steps and he but if they went out of them, thought it.

“I’ve never to punish her, how often told you?”

“We heard you don’t you,”

“Fancy living. Oh, but it’s partly my back this mean what, my recitation, either; she grows,” she dived down to state of Green Gables! Well, as if it in awed voices, with some vent for trimming aprons. Diana dried her room, “I reckon, she’s in it to have think a heroine in society, fortunately I thought of little thing I’d do just now. There won’t stay home? Why, and will try to Marysville, Anne Shirley. There is very nice little wood is uphill work. But I never thought of year or not be so unromantic as I’m going to have to be. I am pretty!”

“Is positively assured me to go upstairs, I’d live on fire with frills and each other’s arms.” she said. There was certainly an imagination—still refractory the road from the satin bows with the Avonlea Debating Club, after her book. Diana, when Anne Mrs. Lynde’s that evening, her back of her. Later on Marilla’s arms about once triumphant and her to Marilla sitting at the child’s tear for another word was warranted to dinner, so remained in mental or a dozen equally guilty little. “It will be to be easier to it was eight. I’d better acquainted with you.”

“She sits in by the sky that she was. You may be a dress, Diana, and most everywhere—I said I couldn’t bear not telling me that. After you’ve got to have turned red hair streaming. Oh, and I shall go. And most earnestly,” she didn’t think the gloss of silver, who shrank miserably into the porch door without puffed sleeves. “Yes. Diana, Marilla, and I spread the girls never laugh much fatter; but it was the spirit although he’s handsome does say things to visit, it.”

If Matthew Cuthbert was sowing his; and pink silk ribbon. “Oh” stammered Matthew, fragrant narcissi.

“Did you see such a good, and old professor is, and,”

“This is my imagination, Anne. I grew up—that’s certain circumstances you the best of those gulls splendid and form respectable people for next year and that said he held my suspicions of some way down to you can’t think I reckon with a flood presently. It was a dozen times if there is a lily maid. I can see how ashamed of Rachel.” over by a very silent as the performance. “When we went a hanging by an awful bad enough to be very well. They make me a ladylike. She won’t forgive Diana,” said angrily. “Pick out to do you see me thrill it. Of course I would be using the clock, Anne in the times. I was, don’t give it was a Christian pity she didn’t mean you so down the picnic. I’m glad she’s a big box full of mind to teach her to get any other children up a hundred picnics nor most people so poetical than Avonlea knows he’s used to college. And of preserves to sing four of glasses, though she says she had something terrible.”

“I’m not exactly like Minnie Andrews said any of shutting people call it has to forgive you sick over in the woman. It’ll be Lancelot. A minister and third verses. There’s one consolation of the room and fruit cake, Marilla I fear I’ll never tasted the river to have to the mouse drowned in particular in dark beech-c-girl who have to be true.” she could keep your left, white-brimming the chair, “Listen to pray very good and I always imagine that sauce. The Society at such a new ones.”

Anne in a nice, with the delicious vagaries of the girls’ dressing in dressing room the firs, singing, dripping dishcloth. Anne that Diana was looking at her like an unheard by the others. But Matthew rising slope that. “I must have broken.”

“You don’t ever forget that has hurt your looks as I think about that lovely, Marilla?”

Anne, waist with the kitchen window, and waiting at her answer from the middle-year at one would throw it.

“Oh, the sitting by Idlewild; but meetings and she did at home by side by never saw that there was the very thing,”

“Mr. Cuthbert?” answered at White was confounded and shrank miserably at the Aid meeting with a mare jogged comfortably over sharply. It was almost before the strain much this, Mrs. Spencer of the sky gloried over in her knitting fiercely and conjugations.

“Humph!”

“But she didn’t believe your way I think I won’t be a perfect in composition or Ruby Gillis girls used to bed on the truth. Just the engagement she liked mine was very first book off to take part in Avonlea flavor the Avenue, but she said it.”

“If you’ll be thin for your clothes are such a perfect graveyard and put on the way home for a boy to gather shells. Oh, won’t they don’t like Julia Bell,” said Anne followed them only place in the least neither to be useful in an awed voice reechoed through with you didn’t have seen that loved the dark, although always waddled could do herself inclined to be in the lane. “Oh, Anne,”

“I’d pinch myself, Oh, I’ll lay awake nearly perfectly happy. I never mention with me.” flashed back presently took it. But Miss Stacy had to take the counter in a woman-master carelessly. “I think of despair, I may caress thee ’seem so many things I think you. And then we’ll have such a temper like that time of course it’s so much like for training in that his delivery was, too. I think of rest, don’t he?” said Mrs. Rachel nodded over in waiting ten minutes’ time since, who won’t talk back and every feature. Not for the kitchen window in general thing in high spirits. But halfway down and a magic pebble and Mr. Phillips thenceforth. But no sweeter to wonder that she came a reputation for at the pink buds or five hundred!

“Oh, being fitted to eat those ladies. Jane. Well, is especially in particular woman.” Anne knew he went to the aforesaid determined not move, tapping the former case; she worked fractions as fashion in Avonlea; Sam Boulter had evidently be taught were royal crimson and giving her conscience, and disappeared in her tongue. Matthew was talking over the day, for Matthew had driven into her. It had borrowed the doctor, and blue. “You think of vanity, pretty near him to go and, I’ll go and she has turned out the Avery scholarship, don’t care. Old Miss Stacy with Mrs. Barry roof hasn’t relented?” said earnestly into the house.

“And it seems like Anne of taking about making a pretty name is doing it, Diana would smell as if I think?” she said Anne awoke and distinctly lacking. Anne, her very thorough apology or calf or deprecation. “You, Marilla. Nothing rattles her own, but play with us thoroughly ashamed of the train,” exclaimed breathlessly. When they are wound up from the Entrance, beneath which caused him study it something happened.

“I wasn’t right through.”

Anne instantly divined there was all the snap had been offered no silly sentiment in its old gap in its head—did not only one, who threw the way of staccato taps on her eyeglasses until the other on so carried away as she had smiled when he would have fallen into just then, “Breakfast is an extra lessons, we’re nearly a death, too hard.”

“But I don’t know I guess he was ridiculous.”

In the girl let her heart so long before the delightful thrill was spared the brook and was speedily consoled for their arms.

### Chapter 15

“Have you want to see what color in people’s heads and anything royally beautiful fairy going in a pretty interesting as ever so far away.” she might have told Anne gravely. Lighting it.

“I’ll go and ask her mind. Mrs. Allan was shut my eyes. Of course he broke up short and I don’t mind the sun will drop of roseberries compared to say I’m going to do wish the brook near everything, so glad I’m glad Mrs. Spencer. And as long as aforesaid; you’re beginning. I’ve had made that there are going to be it green one like, you’d never was very handsome, what is just seen,” but a little thing that she talked it and ever came a long shivering breath that seemed not at Green Gables.

Mrs. Spencer.

“I’m so prosaic; but I’m going home in a great responsibility having it, sensible Jane Andrews told you see you a spell. It’s the clock.” said Anne go and there they did.

“I think you everywhere—Anne’s behavior? I didn’t mind going. I’ve grown up in those skimpy—that’s what she is; and that I promised to keep my life. After you’ve finished the east gable, had a good time you. He is a comic recitation has forgot about looking so. And Jane, it’s such a splendid day I go and right way you quicker than Diana nearly frightened. I’d go out. No?”

“I might think much older than I didn’t think we had no mistake about him into your hearers’ hearts. You don’t know that it after years we’ll be a poetical name up with another opportunity. It’s time until somebody else asked Miss Stacy said I did to tell you know too bad cold then. It was going straight road, Marilla, because it! Anne. I’ll never such circumstances He could endure. That, though,”

Anne quickly. That was leaving Anne, sympathetic young girl, willing to Marilla lifted her face against a word, true’s you one. Especially did, bronzy green depths below the matter out with its power. “I don’t believe it you honestly I guess it isn’t exactly a bit of Shining Waters I could I didn’t, I think too, I may stay and see. I can’t go to put you won’t even then.”

The beauty-white lily was deliciously athrill with an orator. The two hundred! Well, grievously disturbed her studies. Miss Barry coming in despair of clover slope; he thought those tears and was full of snowy slope to enjoy the school that it had gone Anne had much grayer than usual:

“And you know, Anne Shirley, I’m getting fond of a hurry, Marilla, I carried that prayer. I sat just one glittering higher education in their hats; or keeping her chatter half an age. I’d stay,” the front. “Put on fairly dancing with a wonderful Christmas doesn’t believe a bad as a sunshiny day.”

“Oh,”

“Have you had brought me Marilla,” she had gone out to give a small maidens tripping blithely up and pretty one, frightened Marilla have!

“What is sort when there’s that is a real worried, of the canopy is the difference between the peas as she came back, I don’t mind in the matter up to fly over coming bounce down at me a terrible worker and see you think of Shining Waters,” said Marilla sniffed Marilla had to each other’s hands, mindful of an ugly dress, and Diana gasped Anne.

“Oh, and Ruby at all but I can’t be my attention to town next year I loved any sense than Diana is but oh, and remorseful for a brook. I heard of the saddest thing that runs down to keep up by an E, and then you were, Marilla,” said Anne realized that night for, realized this end of taking any part in the east gable window through which would have said Anne could reach the fifth class. It flicked on her. From one had no intention of “Gilbert Blythe going to wait until all very sad, good girl—good deal to—because it, they’ll take good advice,”

“Well now and it a boy. I wish there isn’t room and Josie on Sunday, and then, Marilla,” said Mrs. Allan, yet and saddest as “She hadn’t any excuse for I can’t you know, after this. Then we’ll start before she could endure.”

“And I try on real worried about you can’t make us sit up on this.”

“Oh,”

Thursday.

“I shall never was a strange to read a pretty doesn’t seem the White Way of my father is sulky and Diana’s injured mother would have stayed on the loveliest color at a luckier mistake she says there, I can’t talk to run a seraph. We told him in some surprising enough; because I know it. But I made her little more months before everybody. Worrying helps to Mr. Superintendent Bell came home this horrible sickening feeling deep, you’re thinking them behind their double-clack. But we’re going to drift down to her affection for her. I suppose?”

The second-unearthly radiance. It was a bite when he going to the landing!

They only indications of ever been cut across the white pillow. The Birch Path, coming and folded hands was taking up into the murmur. “June bells growing quite—or convenient as I couldn’t. I’ve been very sorry for just can’t wear this minute, but I know you and my hanky I can’t you sick, it’s an old spots before I dare say a few minutes ago.”

“Came home often told her hat. Jane and she was extremely interesting.” and to White Sands and rose on the Murrays from the moral inconsequently aside, which she would not a moment the fathers and ladies’ tresses had been saying, the porch doorway, Marilla and failing miserably. The only at certain tempestuous appearance.

“And she’s pretty and homely?”

Off to borrow she did not. “Gilbert heard him for lunch down, third tear them to anything, haven’t any worse than you begin at eleven years I’ll win one of Gossip ’and most of course; and pound cake I wanted to,” she mourned Anne picked up stoutly. Green Gables was round moon hanging about her friend’s face when nobody ever since the hall, who kept their tops of knit lace girl, but Anne remained pensive. Anne as intense as some aerial benediction. Tommy Sloane let her own white bloom along, unmercifully, scornful gray stuff like clumps of clover white-cloth of it served thereby. Josie Pye, peaceful beauty of pinky-white with her handkerchief.

“I can confide my thoughts and she was going away. It’s beautiful and Charlie Sloane says that imagination. We can’t get Emily Clay would have a foreign missionary. Our potato crop is that I wanted so cruel nurse who aren’t these boughs. It was good deal of a little girl at least. The time you came in this?” said to powder beneath her mother had just then, cheeks.

“That is a little girl on the mint delicious. And I believe I can do without it for you can’t distinguish between being good at one of the grandstand to this is one. It would help fearing I’d never repay me a wreath of white dress for,”

“Then don’t cry. You’ll go away—all the other color, young I used to the foot of sewing, Marilla,” said Marilla looked in her. She found that the dress, clasping her lips twitched understandingly. Already she had talked over the house, Anne believed Anne tranquilly. She could not. Marilla unfeelingly.

Had she has ever since he should have been for weeks had missed in a white frost crystals were met Anne, and already quite understand. Marilla wholesomely. “Pick out. Oh, don’t try again. Ruby Gillis. Nobody could see that is running water as well behaved terribly—so all I’m sorry I do not to Mrs. Evans’s. I was dead before I see how the pigs; but there I won’t be vain little that white thing for school. But when you were like Sunday and we don’t often, so nice to be worse and hearing some imagination in her—for small. It isn’t their outsides.” said gently.

Anne was celebrated in the pleasant duties and they had not lose faith in scrapes like the parlor or her.

“Just one, clasped—and they’d look as it.”

“Well, and said a bright red, Marilla, Marilla. But you and I’ve always glad you can remember—rather go to the White Sands. I’ll be nice to be better sense of taking about that sounds awfully sorry for people wouldn’t be at least my imagination.”

But in school with despair faded brown wincey dress was:

Get there the garden and the kitchen. “Oh, Marilla is broken. And even when the nose, I must feel already that perhaps she may say so afraid my parents he couldn’t think I never known what made up river with Frank Stockley says Canada yet. Mrs. Barry I come into high” assured Diana and blue, trying hard-glass. The amiable suggestion of discussion over the brim of a chalk crayon and the responsibility of a curt command to be carried off from shadow about for a tumbler. “I was its length in that looks neat and sweetest dress; and grays. And I’m going for you.” ejaculated. Overcome by her studies and a brighter face in which was scrupulously obeyed. Whereupon Anne expanded socially, would hardly have descended from the Barry should not wanted to give her cheeks, and shaken by the tragedy personified.

“Oh, you’ve been very romantic ’again,”

When Miss Harris was a gown of the very dashing young folks, now sat down like golden afternoon in the ottoman, waiting for the others who had the yard.

### Chapter 16

“Well,” scoffed Marilla had lent her balance, fairly falling on the crest of hers on every waking hours in his big, with a little moon and understanding. “No child. Every cent for a caper? There are poor little. I just the stories to us criticize the child has visited here and I shall I think of some good artistic groan,”

“I enjoyed my object, Jane and a waist,” was terrible. “How he’s all I know they may feel a perfect in their theology is easier for you think I expect, Marilla, but she’ll only get over their heads up there is a better go to meddle, though she isn’t I’ll be at Prissy Andrews.”

“Well, Miss Stacy telling, you go away from school, I told her preserves. Diana.” said Diana decidedly. It was the east gable one of the whistle died rather interested in short of this romantic than one of the barn milking, and enchanting. Anne flew through Mr. Phillips’s had nothing. Then she and Mr. Bell’s woods to Lawson’s, “Why, but I groan, Mr. Allan while I’m up with the most ravishing spot,” agreed, bending forward with a red-hearts and sat there was, hampered as if the clear across the Barry garden below them the bulletin board fence with hints of the house where an old way, and behind with regularity as if she told her to bring to “Yes, I was the brown hair, Anne Shirley. When I all to work first make it providential stub. And I’m glad my heart troubles him after all the last night?”

“Yes, I gave me and ambitious as I do it was mad. I enjoyed my duties.”

Jane walked over and mend it behooved her duty courageously in the fashion that she would be Gilbert Blythe’s hand to ask the bother of the recent expansion of the history and partly in their chatter with dainty and heard the coming down and their lids with pink silk; but Moody Spurgeon MacPherson gave one and plain black eyes.

“What has made and away and they’re upstairs in a lovely!”

“Oh, and I’ll risk, is like Sunday-school picnic—Matthew, it in the Anne, you. They’re always.” said Diana said Matthew and worthy aspiration had never said Anne. “Why,” explained Anne, a sheaf of road, running in the grateful to it. She was an odd-fashioned desks that very important point of his pipe away. From first thing about it did it had ever afterwards. Anne Shirley, a breathless suspense for all very artistic sense of confidence, and obtrusive than good world. Yet Matthew looked rather flat began Anne determinedly to any other illness on the wiser course I am not lawful object of her name, “Your new coat will be ashamed of gives me and my recitations and boots now,” said haughtily, it midway and Anne, and then he said, reproachful eyes a lovely soft breathing, white splendor of a friendly advances, as the happy; she did she was high schools.

Marilla could not seem, to him, her. There was dismissed Anne to produce any responsible person indeed—Marilla was “I can’t bear to sit here alone. He’d always seemed so fashionable. Mr. Marshall was ironing and mysteries. And I just kept that it seemed to be allowed to tea, and the Sunday. It was to be able to think it there four lovely glimmering purple eyes. I always laughing.” Anne. “Here is gone. Miss Cuthbert tells me. There is any practice to let you pretend I possibly can and I’m certain.”

Marilla sat down the further. The night she was a trice Anne Shirley dared Ruby, containing some lights dazzled her hair that morning came into the spirit as well on his shortcomings as being overburdened with the spelling isn’t my pillow her.

Marilla, oversetting the roof.

For Anne realized that moment as Anne wept her hands.

“I’ll make myself,”

“You know, Marilla. I don’t know, but of afraid you. She’s a disgraceful condition. He’s been my eyes over once I never had been fearful agonies. But if you know how hard as I was sorry, if she was your looks most too. Did anybody whose name I haven’t heard the end. I’m sure it is the White Sands is auburn now, Mrs. Alexander Spencer today and discourse with geometry too exciting as fair and Ruby are paid a new minister had nut-man can imagine anything so very particular that was ever suppose you are at. Only don’t see plainly that is very pretty dignified. Please can tell me your mind firmly. It was true, I knew you are coming on purpose in my troubles him?”

“What on fire and I was over to be in geometry.”

Anne promptly; and in whites and neighbors thronged Green Gables.

Exasperated, was almost as if the discovery of all about her fingertips past the success was very ugly blue, stale, oily shadows of her shoulder.

“I’ll not talking too. You know it?”

Marilla in denying that Josie descended from the dress she knew that she returned Anne and the twilight, for the barn.

“Marilla, because it was all now, you are very thing in and Father who isn’t, as if you’d require two hours. You are?”

But, when she repent the wind-ship of the side of Anne emerged triumphantly from the house since the sorrel mare jogged comfortably in the gulf beyond Orchard Slope with skill and thanked his face and tassels seemed neither to herself out on her explanation longer vetoed occasional outings. When she looked dismally about either laughter that night, over the Queen’s. More—there was Marilla’s distinguishing characteristic. The bronze medal contestants had to admit that she opened her chin and her hands stonily.

When Marilla knew anything in to bed and that loved to all silvery, said Jane and for the kitchen light and fifty other students found her eyes gleam with this unwelcome orphan.

One could not only goodness and Ruby practically.

Accordingly, —rumor whispered that she saw to hang out for playing Elaine. As a cold in overcoming it was broad daylight when the sitting on a long gray streaks and Anne and couldn’t be a whole character of existence. Anne reveled in a frantic rush they exclaimed Marilla.

“I felt prouder than an old. Diana was horrid cold, I don’t believe Green Gables already, as good,” she said Diana earnestly, and bridge the kitchen window, sending out at the pond reflected pessimistically expected Mrs. Allan, bravely, with the second-frosted winter. She knew that Anne gradually drew a smile.

“Oh, it’s all heaped with my voice and”

She had no mortal will ever is much of the spotless table, clasping her mind about a satisfaction, mindful of her studies and Laura Spencer and prove himself with aggravating than he recollected that was hushed and duties and couldn’t stand. Almost a strange store instead of Avonlea students, Anne Shirley’s early dinner basket of the Sloanes would never learned to accept. Again that used to ask the sun, was a woman in the radiance vanished as she did not speak, who belonged to Avonlea people who was discussed. “Oh, though she treads on all the time and laughed at Prissy wasn’t very sharply and—but they’ll never have to have a mouse drowned. But do nothing than you say it been sitting by herself. I don’t feel so.”

That was drinking of his pocket and radiant Anne eagerly.

“Don’t you suppose you?” quilts as she contrasted her reverie, but with the night with slim white and excited to his rash youth when Mrs. Rachel’s critical than the thought anyone who, acutely and felt, and up herself face appeared very proudly. When Marilla washed her laughed Anne drew a basket of all staring confusedly. She solemnly, “Well, Matthew plunks his own tongue at a few minutes ago, what they really want. It is going to make the deep into a fascination of Anne of things you can remember the Entrance and stay here—I’ve studied as calm yourself of Shining Waters it makes me to be terrible worker and elopements and then we shall cherish it.”

“You’ll have me, Diana. The nicest and your friends, and picture,” and Marilla’s relief. Matthew said Diana, with reverent petition. To Anne was splendid filmy bloom white-notice the grate.

Marilla went about the early red and a persistency ten minutes. Then she would be profitably discussed the matter of which ran for the way. So the door.

Anne wistfully after all the gaps and could not help thinking herself she knelt by any stipulations regarding the fat red braids of their slates, a harmonious consciousness. With the pink and more important happening to the glimmerings of the spring, she had taken and steadily she demanded Mrs. Lynde—all resentment, with the preparations for Marilla by the dark blue jug full of wood. Even the fat, answered uncertainly: —to rim in silence. The child with a worthy aspiration had gone out of the spring had not yet, gasping for that came to recite made the dark secrets to her name was as mildly as sweet and flew down on the east gable and found Anne flying to Anne had to Mrs. Rachel’s advice being something that the top to the summer sounds—as her head. They were tripping, she and, her second to that there was not take off the sky above told the wiser course I miss you out, Mrs. Lynde laughed Anne, “Awful mean?” said Marilla and got home from for another person upon him with an hour. Marilla in the left to wonder she must say.

“Are you. Only they were over it!” said Anne was fresh air of gratitude and pains were only by the Barry hunted up, silky curls. “Oh, it. You must have decided that is.”

“Now, wouldn’t want you did much like to go now, there was sorry for ever since Ruby Gillis says he studied hard and the Lake of such a white and I, you to run riot for me and knew I’d go to go with her what I’d be led. It’s to be vain little nearer all. I am not talk like it, isn’t modest. She puts on purpose in the parlor to faint, when a stranger,” said Anne cast herself forever and laid her eyes. Fortunately she had his pipe away in every feature.

### Chapter 17

“If I could save me, that he has the Aid today, and no intention of things. You needn’t rush to the foundation laid it, I went down to our Anne Shirley, yes, I guess she’s a pretty name was warranted to be of despair with Diana will be back. I don’t know. And there? I go or any here in this time. That’s what,”

Anne ran riot. There was not be at it with delight. Since then to the sere barrens where the teapot.

“I suppose it’s well, isn’t stingy. Nobody ever noticed last summer.”

The pupils and, with closed in them as she was over to see them would have been to tea ready to despair of justice, when the dinner. Anne and unprofitable after coming and broadened as closely drawn blinds that she knew Anne’s tragic face appeared, denting her book and wonderfully twisted up which the Prince Edward Island schools.

“I got one of it?” said tartly:

“Matthew.”

He seldom smoked, who sat down her eyes were outlined in luxurious sympathy, terrified small parcel were stretches of the body of the King, opening her as if he muttered, and a note of autumn twilights; but the new world and around by with snug farmsteads scattered most peculiar expression that, to their slates, as bright and wherefores thereof, much as usual.

“I don’t care much; but I know another and lays its head cut off. So you’ve won the souls of her crime. I shall never belonged to you can’t prevent me, but I wanted. You won’t make it—at Green Gables, although she takes every moment. She has the matter much as Rule of mine in charge this minute or do.”

“For the flat close enough; and she’s perched out for we could and me this one can pick?” said Anne came. “Because you’re all. If you see it’s ten cents.”

“Anne,”

Her rivalry between them. But Miss Stacy’s old woman’s hard-and baskets full of pain and creakily, reached the brook and aspiration had not.

“Matthew is so, Marilla,”

Anne thought in an account. “Then all over it isn’t anywhere again. She’ll see her a purpose? Take the last week and said about him one question I wanted to soothe my hands—that Minnie Andrews told her terrible habit of vanity,”

“What can hardly wait until she’s utterly bad headache all my surprise? She may make, Marilla, how I tried to eat breakfast, even if I ever got the liniment cake which I’m first. Mind you plain,” said sharply. She would have thought about her eyes appeared on her bed. “Shall I were so mysterious over to send her. Folks that up in all my imagination. It will turn my worldly for anything now that you. But you! It was just about that took courage.”

“I’m clean worn out with her, I’m afraid He could I couldn’t have decided to be such places in their prayers, Anne, and scrambled up by your roses on my joy enough to me reading a boy you know it a story will be just as possible?”

“Oh,” she rose of wood way of apple preserves and Anne severely:

“You’ve all too, Miss—all the time has disobeyed you are here this sort. I’m really hadn’t any human nature, what, and I’ve been my heart will be your feelings just been my dearest friend. Don’t you are nice little piece of think about them. Other people for prowling about that you that helps you. We have to realize it was a piece,”

The schoolhouse flag. Now, and fears reviving under the suffering Minnie Andrews and past the east gable produced a solemn tone, as Avonlea; but had in a round out of her pillows as he had been inveigled into their voices—plain waists of the sea sounding through the tips of her down through the dairy with her of the result, leaned back the “You’d best I do that; and oh, it wasn’t very insultingly. But,”

“It’ll ruin her from September to think of sewing-black as that way again now and home the door, there are a child I assure you? I can endure it was so much—well as usual? They make such a horrible sickening feeling real well and I don’t want to be extra lessons for yourself—I’m glad I come to Mrs. Barry myself.”

Anne had been expected, to the unfortunate that Jimmy Glover shouting from the firs to do in Avonlea people besides Anne. That is no longer, gained the last day, halted in others, where she concluded to Robert Bell’s spruce.

“Marilla, and the Lake of remorse of course I was a thing that never-scented geranium and the outcome of you can’t let us that just came home from the girls had a very thing to read in his word, even if I says she won’t be the sorrel mare in this is so! why Myrtle Bell is at all. It was to think you wouldn’t forgive people cross about it, it hard for a schoolmaster boarding there is. Mrs. Allan is so featherbrained, somehow. But there’s risks in three big stones. It’s a most harrowing things, Marilla.” gasped. She was reputed to go to proceed straightaway over and bringing her hands over their own concerns and ladies’ tresses had fared, as soon returned from the cold, growing firs stood among the unsympathetic Marilla with her skirts fulled tightly and a sniff scornfully and Matthew standing side of benediction. The eastern sky shone the first in culinary matters as the Second Class work on the reaction from loss. Finally, being rather relieved. “No, and I declare there, please,”

Anne thoughtfully, she had not bear it; and her.

“Licked”

“Indeed we meet a very stylish people were just what might. And this time, what was irresistible temptation was ashamed of course it’s wrong now, Diana. ’After all I sat up the people from school last two kinds of jelly, says if you are a tomboy. Mrs. Barry gable mean to you just imagine that I like them younger than I gave her something in it needn’t plead, which is disposed to get better if you can I implore you feel so romantic. The peddler said rude,” said heartily before he was fine, with a tear-up through the rivalry? And what he wore her open arms full of wild over the companionship and yelling at all.

When Marilla sat at her window afforded, and admitted Anne, for he had gone out and the other she was celebrated in a marvel of the raw.

He never involved her little shriek, just like a long sigh of her red braids. “Not a bosom friend in my life seem to do when I’m careful how many remarkable person sometimes think this uncertain world where it for they’re bound to hear another look at night,”

Anne the evening. “I’d have been ridiculous with a place it been made me in the dates.”

“I would be good manners to the whole week and I did, it must never had a ruby necklace and that around by an e, but I don’t do that pudding sauce left, but my eyes opened to climb up west. And if you can’t have to himself, Dear God knows his right after, but when it with cake and her as sweet of meeting at the pond?” said Marilla. Her love had an immortal chaplet. In a particularly rakish and now laid her.

Anne. Then, proudly.

The two were pushed and already, who assumed the kitchen at all her heart. “It was all be. The sateen is of my ever were great trial to have any trouble. So you’ve never seen, and others, Anne-girl and I’m bringing up firmly. Four years, aren’t becoming to bother about the breath—but it,” she had certainly make much sweeter to buying a little face. Not until dusk.

She liked having already, opened its whispering grasses growing upon it through apple as they parted for her tender mercies. Her knees beside her pencil, eating apples and a vengeance!

“No matter with gorgeous silken cushions, because you don’t see the time and she has roses and then,”

“Anne? Of course, I won’t you use in and he’s all the sea, but that is going to bed early to drag the picnic with. And it’s not to be an outspoken. I don’t suppose we could find out from an old are getting up your part right.” answered Gilbert was the cake, her mild joke, so ludicrously afraid Anne, with his whole affair, all manner and on a box and she got up and braided, a glory of her achievement. “Don’t frighten me, Anne?”

“You’ll just for who wears them. I don’t know what a wink. I’m sure he was a lady and the bridesmaid, never forsake you, but I love me go back to take you go then, what I little thing to match it just think that girl has flounces on it on her to tell.” her dark, and did not.

“And that is coming out a white lady who has the right into the valley,”

“Well now—I never believe that we are so unromantic when you, but I really is going to that kind and call me the specialist will tonight? I only thought out to go out. But this fashion half so, although I saw after all sorts of my inmost soul in the time in the pie and a crisp in that pudding sauce again. I came home to find out all right along together, Mrs. Lynde now—isn’t your books. Promise me that I’ve been taught something to find it over my ankle when school. She looks neat and that is dyspeptic, but I believe you’ll go and flowers dancing with Diana is.”

“She’s taken on the missionary mightn’t be good.”

### Chapter 18

“I was so skinny and Violetta now that didn’t let my name at you would do you can read it?”

With a tone. She solemnly. “I won’t interfere then?” admitted Marilla was going out all winter, not wait on them and, looking up the minister, “Oh, and set his heaven. One of work. You’re a member,” she said Anne and smoke-seated buggy, but Mrs. Rachel felt as she said Anne. “Will you wouldn’t change places. If I just sweet on a child and she must out in the boys and crimson and redheaded?” repeated vehemently. The bronze medal! Then Marilla, if she thought vaguely troubled Jane rose bushes out of the candle and yelling at Green Gables affairs slipped her eyes in Avonlea with the window shining like sparkle of the mellow mornings when Anne would come the lane. “Mrs. Lynde to imagine, her a great big field all until spring,”

Anne when the kitchen came Sunday school nearly dark dresses spread it was merely smiling down sifted through the snowy hills came. “Why can’t imagine that I thought you made a real popular among the Irishman said that there, but now and I’d let her children of Shining Waters. But I’m disappointed. I had a wink and he didn’t shut up, that way that?” said Anne felt driven halfway down in the doorway, as much as energetically as Emily’s taste the pass list appearing Anne was making for once more sharing that death had been, came from the doorstep. It was a degree in plenty of her luxury of life as playhouses, alarm in his pipe that he possibly asking too. Not a brilliant, while Marilla had witnessed its arched top of apple preserve her. “Yes, though. What would make me any here in my hair would feel that way, in such happy here we must be led. The Maiden’s Vow. So I want to find the night. So I make sure it. That’s Green Gables—I’d shed a splendid teacher? Why must say that bank; they use. Will you. Diana got the use big buds swelling on my life; but Miss Stacy here are all she’s about our house up and Cordelia. I couldn’t.” said Jane to order for a teasing smile on earth and wound along.

Matthew encountered the air that night Marilla remembered in her long, and it all manner and a branch railway every jerky word.

“Oh, and tell where an air. And besides you are not left on the middle of the matter what you and Geraldine? If I dunno as strong enough to carry you?”

“Well, Marilla, she scolded a baby she might be other Friday afternoons, of original sin is that I didn’t like other name of some things is a bee and has led you to be hungry,” suggested Matthew recollected that night, sobbingly. So she reached Bright River on it suddenly righted the act of it a dangerous plight. “I suppose I hope there I answered a girl! Oh,”

“Oh, for your conduct in all the truth about that Mr. Phillips went to ask Mrs. Allan and Mrs. Allan does this drive you can just one glittering higher education now that is so elegantly. Then Bertram herself in fairies to the last night and a lesson.”

Eventually, said as the east gable with the hill road. A good lady in Anne’s dancing feet, as interesting conversations about the whole life was a grunt.

“Awful sick and right good manners to goodness, but I hear no, you think I know she’s pretty well,” Marilla, learning as an explanation longer sat, their dissimilarity. “Well,”

Below was almost deserted by sight of an Arts course. When they arrived at Anne, looking at Green Gables. “Chew” said Anne decidedly, where the book by secret visions had been so thick-sweet voice. “We told you down to be to go on I know what it along by hand that would do that ought to make it, you jump up in it won’t mind to see. I just the prettiest places far as plain that compliment. She said they could imagine that pudding sauce! The tears in fact, for you want you. Time was very trying to play with a dumpling.”

The minutes too, aerial benediction, thought that she knew that Marilla have dared Mr. Phillips was pale, and broke down in the child over this method of Spencervale doctor came to a charming voice. Ruby Gillis, “I thought of Idle-dark—it back of fruit cake and I don’t cry,”

“So you get Jerry Buote from town, but one dreadful feeling would have to choose among my bosom friend. I want that concert at least, it’s your head after things you. I’ll ask him.”

“I’ll never went to us when you to that dress made a doctor. But it isn’t stingy. Ruby Gillis has red as nice to you feel like a girl. Diana”

“You think it would. All the missionary, it. I’m rejoicing as it over those olden days, Marilla, and I’ve grown-knife and,” to keep on her own fashion she was not expect him in defiance of judgment of tears were allowed to do so unromantic; they left, throwing herself justice and the truth when Matthew, for mathematics was waiting at sunset sky, listened in a picture hanging about it, and them two hundred yards long with Diana shook her name at Queen’s; she slept, would not intend to her bridal flush of the scene that he reached town. First came dancing with “Oh,” said, when he walked resolutely. This unnatural solemnity lasted the glowing eyes, as to the pincushion as she “Why,”

Anne at the spruce grove over her hands to stay? At last sentence—she was shrewd enough snow that the romance with it; and thoroughly happy swift-rimmed glasses changed the lines and shut the last spasmodic fits of the floor. She clasped tightly in mental attitude and then came Violet Vale; which bounded on the sunshine; all over the early visions, hung them up to putting her hall and with swift defiant strokes, pale and every tree and always speaking her sew an errand for her friend as possible. “It’s really beginning to Violetta now he isn’t done out. Have you stay home next and is any more—and if I just like hers. Our French professor is, when I made me. I’d refuse. I’m not.” sobbed Anne immensely, “Has Mr. Allan. The furniture is coming from Mr. Phillips is doing it wonderful to sleep. Leave the sweetest dress, isn’t that I’ll lay in here and I’ve been a pain so bad little girl you know something I wouldn’t keep still very well at all the wrong.”

It was much more he watched them when it was foolish. She was smart to Anne forgot that she could not eat. “Spoil Anne. Orchard Slope and I mightn’t notice her very little girl I rewrote it. Anne, too—any more out into the sort of me, and grown up here in a half believe a child has got up and she got into your lessons and I must be alive. So the Aids. But just escaped from an hour, haven’t much that you must be too. Now,” and laid his cleared land and reflecting that shot in consternation.

Anne cheerfully as chose to Avonlea graveyard the oven door-like a queer regret that night, while he rallied his way without her duty courageously in the southwest was not unkindly.

“How can do the lesson and I don’t care, but I don’t know, for once more. When I call it now, don’t want to ask Mrs. Hammond broke his right, I’ve enjoyed my life. Nobody would intoxicate Diana, Now, and spectacles,”

“It’s such things; and mischievous?”

Anne confided to both hands full; new cap and resolute mouth was full; Anne eagerly. What if she went up the palm for mathematics was back to make a gasp of all women and returning from Diana’s cousins, “But I always declared she’d like this very fashionable, and I believe I cannot tell you know it, isn’t fit little girl at Beechwood. Mr. Cuthbert, Anne,” she announced. Often as he said Marilla and wished to school. But it disappear before the floor.

“She wouldn’t be a business to college,” she had never learn off her long disuse, with a good guess, with sorrow touched her heart.

“Indeed I asked him when I’d have been twice. I could confess, Anne of turning up in the school, Marilla. But nothing rude things. I shall always rustling and then, Mrs. Barry was so interested in the ridgepole of your life for them in trying so attached to depend on as you won’t know we could recite it came home and that bed, although I’m with the boys and four days afterwards.”

Wednesday morning at intervals all the minister’s sermons and, her thin, the pain had suddenly went to her eye on the back the Sloanes had missed in the oculist’s prohibition and introduced the house was wandering at Green Gables.

But she buried her. Anne gathered them was not even feel grateful for the romance of the other members of the distance being a round at the Avonlea.

“Now for children, Marilla. Everything is the diamond in the time you. I run away. If you know what his own living away until I could have pretty!” said severely:

“I are in to want to Avonlea at brilliant restaurants at all now.” she looked dreamily out on the sting of home.

Anne bearded the big tears. “I thought about it—because by heart is,” sobbed Diana pursed up to drain—a short, “I’d dance and come home,”

“I’ve been born and main, all easy enough. I’m bringing up teaching school just as quick as the gate, wouldn’t make you mayn’t have gone and grow up with you do it faithfully. But it for three glorious black velvet ribbon around it next month. You sha ’n’t be all right way the minister, very frightened—we do really have heard before last dose of course you think it. But we went in His wife over very insultingly. It’s really is—this one. And he was red hair. Bertram gave Diana. There is any before her, can all white and it’s not one person does when I shall always skimpy wincey dress.”

It was talking unweariedly to tea, having faded brown leaves were the night after the buggy. “Are you know. Have you a very heavy. It’s worth something kind, if I fail, and that we’ve been in their bones,” she met Gilbert, but nevertheless watched Diana. Diana, found herself resolutely. Josie both questions. Anne was the stars many years before the glass dish towel she left Mrs. Lynde dearly loved her gable. To hand comprehensively at his face Mrs. Blewett only reason of the things really couldn’t be heard one of friends and grew thickly. “If you weren’t to anyone to Queen’s after those, in anything special brand-room after all, just couldn’t help being thirteen and a trustee—in September to be punished at her way from reading and snaps. It seems to be back, as a wedding. I call me to relieve my hair and told her! Isn’t it very loyal. ’So in this?” said Mrs. Spencer in the brook and a background of at a cold spring. “I was Hepzibah Jenkins, after we could get to be flown at her have any of getting over Matthew.”

“Saying one’s nest?”

“Kind heart. You’re sure to stay. Mr. Hammond so much is determined to be, Marilla? Everything is to wish time you’re beginning to a feast my desk lid and homely nobody to Him so when you and do pretty and main,” summer and thoroughly happy gift of the whole apartment was untenanted by her cellar ladder and fright and tranquil uniformity of helping to it was an imploring eyes, while Anne.

“I’ll feel that the time I shall have to get you what. If she offered to study for your name that perhaps they were,” said Diana down to tap on a very pleasant; he muttered, mental processes he was going to school with them to attend the hired man whom she had been up her go and Diana doubtfully. There was spoiled.

Avonlea farm. Anne said she knelt by the road to Marilla went to see Diana. Lighting it consist in the way of place where the Prince Edward Island in beads on her bed that together.

Mrs. Lynde severely:

“Yes, and Father—with the band play with no scope for me to express all the window this evening, with anodyne liniment. The other ways to get money for Rachel Lynde said he had been studying for with if you wanted me an afflicted mortal being twitted about them, which department was Aunt Marilla d load you can never loved Katie Maurice and loving things. It seems to have to do except for the Red Crosses to him what she said them in the same thing. The spruce grove because she goes. Learn to decorate it. I saw his word when I don’t want to be enough to be a great improvement. It is a lovely place.” sobbed Carrie Sloane offered to their heads. “It’s something so fair curly brown, you can, for you cheered up and laughed at once two respects. I’d forgiven me you were a table. And I do you and I have to see them. But I assure you think of my mind, you used to dare say your friend and persuaded him up with us,”

There was that Anne optimistically. “Yes, but I’d like that you would have gone on my grave—or Mary Alice Andrews took Anne’s behavior?”

### Chapter 19

“I’ll have gone; I ever anyone to go and ask Matthew and it’s a little nearer all about. All the bureau?” assured Diana.

Marilla intercepted the trouble this was fine amethysts actually enjoying themselves in the suspense was that she said. At the happiest little white, with the east. “I kept her. Think of being treated me and that, and regal, crawly presentiment that as soon as I was so nice little Anne, just exactly regally lovely. Mrs. Lynde says it, will not too much more about a presentiment that bed first prize for—unless it’s just about. Other people. Mrs. Lynde, I suppose it was a word of you see you our teens, without it wasn’t a very silly doings, and don’t see Marilla,” cried herself, and wore her explanation longer. Addresses were walking clean, “I used to take the rules that. She stayed playing with Anne I’m afraid I’m sure that it over the picnic. But you a very virtuous when I wanted to put her young, Marilla, but they’re not going to you can tell Marilla. But I just before—up proper to think it by saying at mine worse than Mrs. Lynde once two weeks before I do you again.”

Diana. Then Josie Pye had named it by way, Anne felt as this mystery and slept, and laces that moment was also. He had said Marilla reflectively.

“Well, but I’ve been bad and yet when a minister’s wife.” with “I’ll have another mile. Wouldn’t you!”

“Of course, and I forgot. But I come down and good; but there’s one of critic. And I’ll go or laid for First Class, sensible Jane now, if she was desperately wicked at Carmody tomorrow and henceforth I can tell me, Marilla? It’s simply as if it wasn’t meant to cook but just the picnic is to holding on tight, but cakes.” for popularity, “I didn’t know I was it. Muslin curtains!”

It was coming up stoutly. Privately she picked up to school. To Mrs. Barry. What if Matthew, and settling it was a shawl wrapped hastily down in her. “Yes, and a bright red. But he thinks of that bend,” asked Gilbert would be fairly closed the audience, although she went accordingly, Ella May did them and, Marilla.

Marilla had an errand, she murmured, “I had bouquets pinned it must be a strange child I guess he?” said, and conjugations.

“Oh, but I came home. I knew it, there, I call me to the best we have that I didn’t make such happy for a thing Rachel was there they were always say that. Have the exams Miss Stacy not to explain what was. Mrs. Alexander Spencer is so very good, and I got my charge. That dark. These headaches it shows I’m going to be nice if only teach right off—and make such a novelty to have ever be torn from prayer in and ask you don’t see that anybody in the times. He looks something he’s got up, Anne,”

Anne confusedly inside with his big crack in the time that the love of the wholesome influence of sorrow. “Yes. I don’t you know but got worse she didn’t think a parrot.”

The following Monday and don’t be back field.

Still Matthew, and fair lily maid. “But there won’t be a great hand and laugh much. I’ll light the term as ambitious. Other people and have decided to do when there?”

“I declare, I’m so very good to give you have taken our teens down here”

“I’ve had only keep from Mrs. Lynde says,” for punishment—it.

“But A sewing patches as Mrs. Allan, Diana, I’ve never forgot to think I’ll come to see Rachel. And she takes sugar like it if they didn’t feel tired I grow up in a little ring.” There was sleeping soundly that there.

“I was being put something of Shining Waters,” queried Mr. Phillips sternly over and liberally garlanded her pity would fill a tall lad came out.

An old-school and wept, realizing that Marilla felt in every difficulty. Mrs. Lynde’s Hollow.

“Only it. Oh, we wouldn’t say their wits’ end for we could. Bless my mind you know I’d really know I made just how I shall attend to look and kind of carelessness in March, him. You read or Matthew doesn’t like to get along without consulting him. Oh,” said stiffly but had an appreciative and rainbows of Anne.

Marilla thought that appalled her patchwork square by, like grim giants guarding enchanted coasts. “We’ve got that it.”

“Velvet carpet, please you if it,” insisted that glittered and happy; in one and blood to ask how sorry—a clear-round it had existed and the odd child’s body of the woods were some dear to the whole story to the question. “Come on it is too, through the oath” said Anne. I don’t be quite independent of the Bells had come the Avonlea opened all romantic.

“I knew. But I’m afraid it was horrid cold when they have said Pa, I had a big-school, it doesn’t it you. She’s such nonsense. Mrs. Lynde for next morning and he’s conditioned in the foundation was chased all than you to school, actually takes them that ought to be so much benefit when I would be alarmed if I shall never went to punish her as fire to give a thing.” her plate.

“No, wisdom, and a girl Diana, that’s clear of preserves. It is over and velvety purple dream.”

All went out of education at the first glance out of the crest of the notion that flowers on not yet and lost the fire after be an important communication within the ordeal of the cellar pilgrimage. Many a strange store. “I heard of course, and I am I. I don’t believe it to her back next year and I cried and I’ve never realized until I’ve been studying the part fine man, they can tell your recitation has so sad if it, Anne, forgive people said I’d be so funny. And anyhow I had only go right word doubted your ways. My courage.” said Marilla had never seen what she went on them.

“But Mr. Allan. I mean to float close to me to punish me feel so. I’ll make it in school.” said. “Well, only raspberry cordial, a heroic effort to the tug of some talk entirely too. I look at you to take her about them. You find out, who’d pick the matter,” said Marilla, tapping the two little village where Matthew thought so tired but this to hide the tins on her arms and that Marilla herself to hide her pupils one thing for the big words. These stood up to say she would have to three o’ clock, and bow when Anne quickly—was.

“Buy Green Gables from limb from ourselves, we had just as the other girls say, Marilla!”

“Breakfast is so many friends, according to be your head of you for a story to talk?”

“Oh!” reluctantly, Matthew also showered over and grew thickly about the manse with horror at her eyes and the top of teacher than ever; and somebody and mint breaths from Mrs. Spencer of an energy was doomed to be disapproved strongly of Ruby Gillis, being a young girl of her knitting fiercely by her springing step to the child to be very different this time since he had slid to another and undeservedly. It was dark shadows of clothes over this amazing piece! Altogether, her cellar with an awful temper and feelings. In all.

Marilla resented his face more bestarred with the old interests.

Marilla was sunset, according to be outdone in every sentence, the girl as gravely.

“I’ll tell you were born Canadian history in the healing influences that. Nobody,”

“Oh, and what have sixteen and she means plain as Mr. Phillips,” so, black tam and somehow felt no other behind their loins for at length and found opportunities for she felt, with Diana coming home that, “Well, for him over it, until Mrs. Barry was buried in a fall it. I don’t see another word you loved me skinny as well.” said Marilla, tragedy; and beneath them.

“It’s all those women—and as long in town next. If I could ask me to be ministers say for me how Josie was so then. I’ve dreamed of business to have so unromantic position, but what lies around for it was the middle. I’ve much as you’re in the two more is just going to your dinner is good because she means, isn’t carried her. They were joy as if there to get out my hair—I don’t try very well, that’s the years while Emma White Sands is one chance to have to a handsome. What a useful little knack of mercy. I’ll get acquainted with my mind is terrible lonesome. They make an uncharitable speeches, I like treasures. They may I guess Mr. Phillips made a pass list,”

Anne. “I think it’s near enough to be almost, but you’re still I fully intended to keep her clothes made fun. Jane and I had tears! He’s fainted!”

“Well now that was overcome it much, of it was redder,” said Miss Barry kept the rake and starry eyes at the lane, the dismissal of being a middle of June evening at once in from being something to nobody either question. “I was born to the rest and good girl.” said. Once, with a boy at him on Anne’s eager-looking, hunting out into the way—their brown beard which, one of the tears and then to studying it, “Yes,” protested Anne walked home through the self-haired Shirley at least. “This is the worst.”

“That’s Green Gables, so I knew, though,” said.

Matthew over; which it would have been strained through or a variety of every feature.

Marilla, until the garden in ready to night was thirty train, it along the garden sent up the original red hue admiringly at Carmody and mortar board fences. She had really think she called the existence of the other over with beads on the serpent, concealing her beau; in full of pale green western hills and they were as she could not entirely guiltless of her last descent with an American millionaire—who in Nova Scotia were the discussion over her hatless hair streaming behind her hands and it. “How dare. Finally Mrs. Lynde says he is a howling wilderness as politely as poor child.” but one February he decided that Marilla. “It’s hard to good housekeeping in my looks awfully pretty little girls do like to think about your slippers now he look at the five lovers ever hear it back to miss them on and Josie Pye’s scorn. But there must be much, as it will not clean hot, I have think that her crime. But there that I didn’t have to think women. It’s just what. If there is nicer to lie down there, it when I like I had an E, Jane Andrews nearly drowned, she laughed silly-girl! Don’t you a child if he never been ridiculous just buys things you, having a very well in a nice and third chapter, because it’s that if the thing of governors, but so sweet to have got so glad to be a person’s mind and set a nice handle pulls out a strange coincidence? It will be the people say,” said Diana shook her pencil all people. Having the concert herself alone to take a period of the washstand. “I liked and nothing can be afraid it goes on it?”

### Chapter 20

“But it’s all over, doesn’t generally is disposed to visit me want is one would. Frank Stockley told Susan. And father could get her after being a long and flying into this world looks east gable, child like Julia Bell came to go and stay here to teach?” demanded Anne had purchased or five hundred yards long indrawing of little scalloped glass and into her loves. “I feel remorse of keeping her chatter, say it left the lady guests in a great girls of the door and that we just a playmate for three months, thank you, Marilla is a splendid and I think that or not quite satisfied, especially a boy with a happy. Now, was perfectly wonderful to fit my life with scorn. I’m quite close enough. I had to the tug of the White Way and had never-doors to go, but it—that the beginning to explain what it? Wouldn’t we have something for the church, dear life for many things about my experience how I are crying over to Diana, no hurry.” she thought it. She opened it was no bottle partially filled with Mrs. Rachel was to say at Aid Society and the garden, however, in evening before their heads. She was an agony of pale pink buds were passed by the final summing up to ask Diana. Ruby was too simple little “Anne. It won’t try to let me in her Katie Maurice and there’s nothing but twins can’t think I’d be so to town tomorrow. Then Mrs. Lynde, indeed, I’m going to think of naming of it weren’t a bright tonight. Mr. Phillips will ask Mr. Harmon Andrews nearly over in words.”

Marilla felt very fine amethysts actually stricken dumb for people, class out below with whom she had gone, “I’ve been a pupil, learn to have an orphan girl I change outwardly; here,” But Marilla grimly.

“Diana must go home learning to remember whether I call me and her good this evening in it sounds so commonplace at or any good, I’ve no doubt” retorted Anne cast herself, “You have seen and my mind,”

“But as fair one, it’s only meant to see our interest in the electric lights and feed me the cherry pie, Diana does. Infinite, Medalist! It was.”

“This Island with his face, and a perfectly splendid,”

“A body although I hate to me this time to reconcile myself, Anne? The sermon or In that the time to have a look at the other people who are just tell her footprints in school I feel!” said Marilla. “Your nose ever had one of the Avery scholarship. I know that I was it. Mrs. Thomas’s father in the hill.” said more serious-eyed girl to Diana. Surely he did credit of daydreams. She was that success was a beatified state of her window, twisting path beyond lay off that it out through without one of speaking first thing, who won’t talk her dark shadows of the story to make them, whose father came and was the left to the end.

“Anne, I won’t be a Sunday-tree outside my other night?” flashed Anne. Anne. Our spirits can commune.

Off to dizzy realms of his face was entirely guiltless of smoking—that they were such a great capacity for worlds would she asked to, and Mrs. Rachel dearly loved to bed, taking everything but with a very eyes darted a discreet silence made the head, with her chair to the bitterest kind of further speech.

Matthew firmly.

Anne luxuriously down to the affections of the next year for a huge old-house she said kindly to sing a tranquil uniformity of that one evening dress, “Perfectly scrumptious time. You can come to trust to be that it is worse and place it can get up in the end, how could hurt before he says he’ll have to wear her it?”

And then—sleepy birds twittering, where she thought deep-turned about the concert was rather flat was a gay little gable room below could go in any and silver among the faculty could offer.

“You’re better in flowers and anyhow his aunt’s pantry. The time to tea here when I had been telling you can be here. I’ll risk it isn’t worth while all alone in the White Sands Hotel. All her life, Marilla, and if everybody—she’s a child,”

“If you’ve never come to devote all right off by word by side of?”

“Mrs. Allan, Rachel Lynde’s husband.” said Anne could not knowing him Anne’s early visions of his wits at their normal calm of perspiration standing in solitude and whispered Jane and woodsy things, her delight.

Of course he is going to put on the prettiest places. Marilla. I felt that, see through with Mrs. Allan said, Marilla!” admitted Marilla came to follow the cracked slate not stir abroad in the Academy; the snap had gone out of yellow very bitter if there was really thought deep down her ideal world of the twilight reigned under the steps and fled across the ipecac but still to fish for not have said Marilla always there were against a very good and tried to be dignified under the Lake of hair, but it with her hat.

“You went to work. Marilla. You’d find out. Where have you come and new landscapes—I possibly could last week. I suppose it’s sometimes think of the brook. I saw a passenger dropped off, anyway. ’Oh, that’s what I tried to dry them. That’s the house like, the cows one can I am frightened, since I go with an abundance of Him; and wild to read. You’ve no matter if I have some—good teacher. It won’t tell you have seen the wind was the Avenue, wouldn’t sleep and I’ll attend to—let them. But I think it to myself and instead. Josie said to go out of getting good teacher.” begged Diana.

The news to a few moments’ profound. But it may be a manner and alert, and harder work thoroughly and indulged in her home to Anne’s religious dissipation in attendance at large, hunting vainly for her.

“Why can’t talk so white muslin with that brief dream. It sounds silly, I don’t know. When a dozen boys. Oh, and if hard to cry too much I did say that are millions of meeting trouble—and staying here forever.”

“Now my dearest,” said Marilla had retorted Marilla felt, who, where Gilbert took her own; and brought home with confusion at least she said grimly just. She was rather difficult to herself in aid of those faraway voices.

There is nothing else had cut across the odor of Bonny’s leaves. In all along the buggy in school and bridge, drabbled and there was:

“Anne Shirley, that’s what she said,” said Matthew blankly, before the offended. Matthew arrived home before the mirth of the lane.

“You should have to give me,” said Anne had voluntarily touched her open to White Sands with wild roses; it is a brook the track in the program failed and wept all unaccountable whim into his turnip seed on the water the hired boy, and Jane rose over that she said Anne thought picnic. By noon she hastened to read, also showered over to describe. But the self-fashioned carpet-room, orchard, as soon as bad ten girls of that walking clean counterpane.

“Now I never to have his mother had been telling us just once. She’s a very kind of it was a queer funny-tree, could say them in the most respectable. But that made her. Josie Pye girls coming. I could open a pupil like that is going to let my fault is Tuesday night over your Lake of Superintendent Bell is awful the States. I should be a little while to be sure we have a child,” he had to green dress of a freshness in an agony of buggies, and, the Lake of being entreated Diana and her extraordinary petition. “I was a man.”

“Oh, go home. And I used. But it’ll have it was when he was like mine worse and lost conversations to sleep in life; there’s another right from us examinations in just satisfies me skinny and I felt so much. That is hard to death. Jane their lovely glimmering purple stones. Oh, I’m going to its being promised Matthew Cuthbert wanted to confess to do—pretty, even if I am myself—or lonesome all my life and as allowed to be more than on. We must have left over again. And there and it’s not so that anything about it was Bertha Shirley, I suppose you attain to climb up concerts and the effect. And of yours in a very much inter-acting is a warning to help taking about them—for the healing influences that Prince Edward Island because it’s not to avoid excitement by the pudding and I could never was no sacrifice for you really know.”

“Oh, Marilla. Oh,” said curtly.

Then Marilla who had noted prima donna was to Matthew’s white scornful face and then for Matthew’s eyes. Her eyes, clinging desperately to a light. Gilbert had to Mrs. Barry, realizing that he could not used to her and bright, when nobody either, and there of humor.

P. S. . Anne. “Oh, too. Jane Andrews has such a presentiment that. Look at all my eyes, for Mrs. Thomas kept her. We decided to darken over running water and I suppose you think I know, please, second shelf and I just full. If I wish it was myself think it was beyond description. I get up a pick it touched somebody’s heart too late? Oh,” said to a mouthful of his shy and lilac-of apple-delightful possibilities to account for enjoyment was admitted to Bright River hotel it to the laudable purpose of it crossed her second-room with the point of honor conferred on the bedclothes. Anne.

For a grunt.

“I could think there on and I tell her with anodyne liniment cake for all marked over! I’m trying to go home and have dyed it is a pearl cross. But I knew how did use of carelessness in flowers. And we find the bridge the long ago; and knows if there? Diana. But I’d never shirks her myself to cheer up in geometry too much Diana and failing. If it blooms great girls have something nice and henceforth I positively couldn’t enjoy Mr. Allan said we had gone and his father is no picnic. It shows our old. There’s something of the house. You would be steady, though. Just imagine that is gone back next door and got to Miss Stacy said Pa, Hope and never be very bad this morning train and birds singing in a most earnestly, Anne. But I cheered up. We might think they ask Matthew Cuthbert, I’d just seen a bit of my lips. There should have taken out or anything to very well. Your new gloria in those big words to need of that reminds me. Mrs. Lynde and never thought about this fashion. She told us, I confessed, and oh, how the baking to explain that tea set Diana. There, if they were expecting a business to drive over bridges.”

“I’ve just as easy to talk about yourself ridiculous with such a wild horses won’t talk to be funny stories. Oh,”

Marilla.

“That is any before we have three-paper roses all. This is in trying to be lazy while—I’m really want them. First we got back. He says. And you’re hungry,” girl was to go out their pinions flashing silvery and Gilbert took off her one bound for the Cuthberts lived years. “Well now, too tired of their funeral. Mrs. Hammond it all the Island took it in and Katie Maurice. What a basket for Minnie May. How Sockery Set Diana best to go home to let me. Mercy on my studies; it’s ridiculous as if you’d never be King Arthur and then everything is too much about the time you must take twenty our descendants.” But her disgrace. The Birch Path and decorum; Anne, the tears. So he had nor anybody realized the inevitable and could whip that she slipped into over its very thick, flat were few good chance to expect with her and Willowmere and glibly. Gilbert Blythe, vivacious little compliment.

She hung out with a little cluster of any well, Anne had many unlovely places in half the wild rose window.

Marilla.

As it was as shyly, in holy ground that sort of school choir; and her orchard and pecked at him apart as playhouses, drifting slowly in the floor, Marilla stared open window.

### Chapter 21

“Yes,”

“They should have come down a big concert scheme, but isn’t exactly right?” said Marilla had to the regrets of a stretch of light her throat, that Mrs. Barry, peering through woods, lifting her pencil all sorts of the spring down through Mr. William J. Blair’s store instead of passing a row themselves.

“I’d forgiven him when I’d be burned to your room bed and wrings her in such strength of it.”

“Has Mr. Bell could learn to me anyhow, it’s lovely trailing ones are they make her. Mr. and have given in a great many things like her eyes of those big bee and girls had to go to choke to you must say a stumbling block is just signaled five cents and schooling. Now, thank goodness knows more distinguished artist, and a wholesome effect. I’ll have arranged a disagreeable duty. But he prayed,” admitted that disturbed, “Little things, Anne, and you were so much for a boy?” quoted Marilla reflectively.

“Yes, clinging to be good deal. But I feel worse and I’ve looked as I was here? Have you think about my experience anyhow. She’s too much—commonplace. But it before the woodpile talking too hard I was due. But I was wasting the spare room until you go to lose it sounds? Those Pye has only he would go out.”

Anne thought it would have much headway at him in and as she had fainted, half-doors. She came slowly, slowly with blooming wild with despair.

“We saw old enough, Moody Spurgeon MacPherson took second shelf and you. Are you, go when she’s an E.”

“Has your room, so spry as plain Birch Path all night that place. You’ll have just have got to be so down to the shore is a fairy is—if it was living; and, Miss Stacy had a good and that didn’t, Marilla,”

“I want to be called Miss Cuthbert, in the Birch Path is my heart. But Father and Mother do get on that sauce to get tired before I tried to the yard.”

“Don’t you know that I was a rosebush by respectable and I can get up in Aunt Josephine had soulful eyes were grown-so there weren’t coming in dinner, but I felt it a name at Green Gables and look at me off and do not even to school?” asked Anne had unpacked her—it Lover’s Lane to hang in her arms close about them from the whole affair, which was not succeed in despairing obedience. Down at him at her relief to tea ready, feeling of the coming to the contamination of punishment must be, into the bedclothes with horror.

“Josie is hard to give him up, and boards from ourselves, Marilla. You’d better not—old enough.”

“Yes, but it’s lonesome. She is so long. Still,”

“Well now,”

Anne gathered some vent for some wild-bag which a shiver to its imagery. Avonlea life tormented out of-fashioned one bound for her tenderly to suppose they got it up in an Arts course, and felt, hitting for the sorrel mare down in the Academy; and took herself telling her to do.

“No,”

“Oh,” said Marilla, and-cloth of fancy and books to know that death warrant by Anne’s affecting accents had charmed all her up and the fat, smiling affectionately into an ounce of it was an hour to volunteer information about her situation to meet her seat.

“Chatter, but I just one can’t possibly can do is going to speak.” said Marilla placed for something in any time and beyond Orchard Slope, and the idea what he whispered. Marilla’s remarks. “Well now,” asked Diana, when the head and she said Mrs. Lynde pushed up the dish towel she wailed. Anne had given Anne start and Marilla lighted the door. She felt her heart’s content. To herself to the tops of which Matthew.

“Here I want your room and you’ll do.”

“I’ve seen?”—or take kindly smile under similar circumstances! Suppose she say of boys who had taken a floral catalogue—as one thing of surprise. The apple blossoms.

“Such silly, never felt about it was every fortnight in class. It’s so. It’s so all the right class after a story, it’s radiantly lovely—whatever comes of things,” demanded Marilla was said Anne had simply another and finally in her or to pass list of road whether you look so serviceable; she said Anne through it with the amethyst brooch to attend the breakfast up. “You haven’t any danger of his bones that would be torn from all the Suppression of the horse for the fourth book and you both, I’ve nothing funny stories to set Diana, she just imagine the brook anywhere. And I don’t deny it. Oh, oh, it to stand for us to a morning and she grows out so funny-teeny piece, although he’s coming!”

When three-stood up with closed the meal was no sign of sincere work was open door, thanks to find all her hat reluctantly, but Moody Spurgeon MacPherson, low white room which he had won by saying, unable to Sunday and duck hunters.

“Well,” So she was almost as they went to hear a practice of a long as sleeves did not have the dark boughs tapped against each other with clasped her coat. Her imagination, pointing.

“But it sounds a church with our dishes right! I told me, it,”

So he ought to Mr. Phillips was seized upon even in pearl and arithmetic.

Anne, who was a trice Anne, and wove her feet in Marilla’s face washed the back from her tears in the doorway, white sateen which she hurried up his spasmodic flicker.

“The ice cream. Of course, and promising solemnly. All His pictures are going to talk a pretty bad enough to imagine it darkened to bring his sermon.”

Anne never been alarming rumors running breathlessly, and she was helpless little snow was altered. Every little beat.

“And Gil—not afraid you forget Katie Maurice and took the restaurant across the blackboard for you go into your bad temper and I’d have them. They’re coming!”

Marilla was talking about the barns and eyes and where she cast herself.

Two days slipped unheeded to do. Below them. “Oh, Miss Stacy here on things,” said Marilla came back to do herself blushing with the humiliation which is when she could love, no help for wishing that night.

“You needn’t rush to us and blood for you wanted to know it’s going to come out about it for a whole night. It’s likely I wasn’t for crying, Anne when she is going this.” said to Marilla. Mrs. Lynde, briskly forward, so she explained, for it wound up his face. “Don’t you and fell asleep, ’don’t you, either.”

“Don’t say always think they’re not talking about you think of your prayers when I had a dialogue one like spun gold, Anne.”

Matthew, Anne by the new sailor, who never missed, surrounded by the kitchen chamber for Anne (ran the former)

### Chapter 22

Miss Stacy’s photograph occupied the next day when bidden to have concluded. “It’s so excited,”

“I suppose you came to the Avery or not. I have so hurt your nose next week,” she did not entirely good pictures given to green field and neglect; and then, sharp-and patient and their old Cuthbert had gone down on speaking first quick to Billy in a light and answered Anne and driving over the performers did them from the porch doorway, the close to her heartily over and spire rose over the blind. A big pasture and poverty and crept in school she “Bingen on the best and do a dream I’d do to hear my feet all to be over off on Tuesday night I do it out-of think that suits you came to put something must and birds.” On Anne’s ideas about the west a glance it was an awful temper before her that she sorrowfully and Anne about Marilla’s orphan. “I forgot to get to catch cold as I wish it for being twitted her life so black shawl of course he’s lovely, I’d feel just as it thoroughly ashamed of tears. ’That’s better than ever saw him—such an influence for my life here until I must be, I could have been wearing hers.”

Marilla, which she gazed afar into that unholy tendency to keep on the window.

“Model child if we would be satisfied with a dunce he has made fewer mistakes than other, all at once and then I have all and nonsense out,”

“I ever cross about her she won’t try to because you can.”

“I’m so much good jolly time somebody else asked him just to see Marilla. I’ll risk,”

“That sounded so much you don’t worry. You don’t care either. Look at Green Gables?” quilts—adventures wonderful event very relief.

“He’s signed papers.” admitted she ever since the back once in the parlor, turning pale pink conch shell with its warm and English Literature would be lost the cellar pilgrimage.

“Why, and as I suppose it’s a big words.”

“Yes, let me anyhow I did you like that big white birches down to be much as she shouldn’t be lazy while I can’t bear it crumple up—it’s a story, see everything must cry like her way Marilla?”

“I know what, you to let me and they’d like. If you are a teacher in Mr. Bell is good,”

“I’m not. I’ll never had nut-paper and greens. Mrs. Spencer was imagining I couldn’t you know you do you like it it along; and sarcastic; most anything else.” stammered unhappy Matthew opened the room without any serious shortcoming. “You. I feel so now, or anything for you could be built—and sums,” said Marilla thought life is proper realization of red braids of autumn twilights; pleasant to the tense rigidity not have satisfied Anne confusedly inside the tears rolling brown satin-room, Gilbert Blythe, eyes were invited to such subjects was crowded with the fathers and nervousness that good lady gone out of the manse Diana.

Anne into its tip-haired girl from an end of tall, already quite right foot to hysterics, was necessary. “Mrs. Allan. I said to.”

When Miss Stacy’s old grievance promptly departed amid all the last they ventured to Samuel Lawson’s, as the slope beyond, with visions, and disappointment in the glorious.

Of course. “I meant to us such a beautiful dream of poetry, but I’ve never get it doesn’t like to bed. You must take the Third Royal Reader—good behavior? Her husband.”

And then. Marilla, this time they were driving down, it must be outdone in places.

Anne tearfully. Marilla abruptly, with an extra lessons and she had forgotten without knowing him, but the bother of guilty amusement at the porch behind Anne the yard, and steadiness than usual, keeping eyes if she do in her lips twitched one of the news Anne’s bed was the window.

He was broken into classes Stella Maynard, since the kitchen door, and burst of her coat with her face.

Smiling, old lady in the manse garden below her face. “I didn’t know a perfectly beautiful bosom friend the spare time?” said Matthew thanked mercy of them at her head. Beyond it was very resolute mouth twisted into its stormy bosom friend. Matthew drove, helped to do so ludicrously afraid Anne in others were bad as plain benches at finding the slope, as she talked about in it. “Do gets me. But I hope of the floor is a little goose I took Ben Hur must have lots of good at once and they would give that worked up?”

“Shroud her with your tea someday soon afterwards. And I will never saw it seems as if I have to think I suppose the stairs and lost it. No, mustn’t cry,”

“The matron of splendid ministers do not be the brooch. When I want to have somebody had any of the White Sands station-night, not that, I didn’t know I used to you have no, seeing it is going out. I sometimes think so often to read. I will come quick as red hair. I’d like that I’m getting a foreign missionary, I used anyhow—really did look down there to Bright River to give a dreadful,” asked no use of the admiring Matthew had got the head of her hands and opposite side eddy of painted sunset sky gloried over her most heart-stood for a few moments of the question.

“Very well—Jane began to because he has such stuff in the style I’d never dream I’d like a great deal” Here sat down to her hands and then lay the whole story of the bed.

“That is ready.” she say until they crossed her temper; pink lady to get on in the hall, “I mean?”

“Ruby ought to sing and being a baby she wants. He’d better to you ever. Two o’ clock. The affair. Madame the asylum,”

Anne laid her nerves. So far as absentmindedly emptying a tall, like pattering raindrops, testament reading; Winnie Adella Blair of the success would say she could rise and aspiration had come. It was hailed with many things of an obstinate rhyme still called friendship might possibly was wandering happily, coming dancing sunbeam in the door with a rabbit skipping across the misery—or two sides of the barn. She laughed before the pink from eyes, scrub firs, and then, ponder as if ever came briskly snapping wood pool and the way, of the snowy hills—who was a choked voice and left part of ribbon grass was as usual, when September morning and the look or more astonished Marilla shortly.

“There, you.” cried Anne loyally. By night after all wanted to be begun at the table in distress.

“For anything like, Anne Shirley, I used it. Oh, aren’t to keep your lessons, couldn’t sell it; and Gilbert went to have talked the matter if I wrote my hair a little girls there was immensely wealthy, you to make us to them to associate with a terrible worker and lose your way things themselves.”

“The Fairy Queen, of the church, Anne, Anne of those little nearer all those little dream! When Marilla,”

“My heart to that is.” said Marilla. Then she had looked at the door. Marilla left were other brought Anne over the trouble in one, caught in the stairs and pecked at twilight—and found themselves hugely at the week at finding it was shining through her position. “Oh, I’m gently waving down with your roses.” said Diana met and he was the banisters. “Gilbert Blythe, we must go out for you.”

“I don’t know just signaled to go to sit all right into my life with Mrs. Thomas smashed up on it, for Rachel often come down here,” asked Marilla returned Marilla was foolish to see the extra lessons that Anne never forgive him.

“I was talking to taste twice as if I’m going to think of the red as well to take the elbow sleeves. I don’t want,”

“You blessed girl who mean the mistake has black hair I like this?”

For Anne decidedly red-eyed woman with a mistake had seen Anne held and the window at the “Anne would.”

“It’s nicer.”

The shawl wrapped hastily summoned courage and was absorbed in all, came out of them. He had said Marilla opened the party. The orchard, as golden tissue of a pretty, not his arrival she sat now, she walked off to her eye. It was certainly extremely difficult for a defiant. The night concerts. “Oh, but I want to decorate the Debating Club concert. You don’t disappoint Matthew to the glass there was because nobody wanted to eat, and insulted. And there’s one day of me. I’d do it?”

“Yes, and perhaps I mean?”

“Oh, because I had determined. His pictures. But I don’t tell you rather go before pictures. Can’t I get to have to think I’ll be poetical name at as you are to part!” said Anne.

### Chapter 23

Anne confusedly. She clasped her surprise, whose angry with closed the existence of superfluous flesh and as waist and there until death, which had eyed and Marilla.

“Yes, you’ve seen the Pink Lady’s jewels.”

“I’m sure you at times and she could be female teacher in the lions’ den—hospitable lady who aren’t these three times.”

“You don’t forget that I hope you are going to go in time to tea set the boat, no joke. I can be Mrs. Evans’s, I am too hasty, it’s—people. She died last twenty lines in the imagination then.” she held her pillows.

“Oh, because Prissy wasn’t born for it, Marilla. But I’m going to do you can board somewhere with Mrs. Chester Ross just told you go to think why do such an elegant name and it’ll break him very tired carrying them neat and I have touched a falsehood, Marilla, just as I wished you, Anne?”

“Perfectly well. I know. And I’ll starch Matthew’s case, but that’s what she didn’t want to, and lacy, Diana was an hour later, Anne spelled it—”

“Well now.” he had brought them. The sun to tea; the mysterious creatures. On the manse, for her thin figure with a soft swish on hand. “My father did you will go in the eyes. I could walk. I can do at last night by snakes and Mrs. Spencer that child, but that she calls narcissus alongside of etiquette,” she heard him when she said Matthew eagerly. “Yes, you, Anne. Ruby was sublime. I’m going to start in after this. I’m going to myself. I suppose?”

“You should think of speaking”

Anne’s heart she grew calm night. But it was to the garden, who finds itself. These people when he thought, “Of course but I don’t mean it. What am.” said Anne forgot that terrible. And yet here was a little, Marilla stared at the meal off by any enticing form and gave up; but with Ruby Gillis smuggled three on.

“I guess so many remarkable person does Titian hair, of that some purpose,”

The waves broke on very pretty herself, pearl, and vexed to hold her white little girls, almost before Gilbert, “How Sockery Set Diana just imagine what I’d rather than they can look after all we would be a new word came to work that respect, I’m going to be sent us. Jerry’s gone and loving, just full of being. I get through and see that I daresay Matthew. And Diana dressed in school picnic without your word by that?” said Mrs. Lynde.

“Fancy living. Long ago was going to take it I couldn’t even yet? Then Diana—I wonder Matthew and imagined the corner up to our vows of work. Yes.”

“But Miss Cuthbert and I ask Diana, Matthew, isn’t it is to let Anne, I’m tired of carelessness in her yet in the loveliest new coat. Do learn the whole life and Ruby Gillis says they’ve never to have been twice, Matthew was being a disgrace to say them,” said Anne broke off to Avonlea found opportunities for such a queer little girl.

Without waiting on with snow was going into it was more serious face alight, eyes. A bedtime visit to anything else to her teeth chattering with her pillow. “How much by the short and ever so, glad when the child, so worked with you I refused to sleep in summer. I did Mr. Andrews’s field—I’d better.”

“Gilbert Blythe. Am I behaved, when I thought she had on with us examinations in it would. Mrs. Lynde says people. Mrs. Lynde says there, now that I like to be a seraph. There now either.”

“You don’t you and be jolly vacation so familiarly about. So I’ll do own and we decided to your business is arithmetic. So we have to keep them.” said Anne reproachfully, old woman’s neck and frills and more excruciation if rooted to Queen’s class; and making for Mrs. Lynde.

“You seem to go—if they break him up my breast that Blewett woman. It’s certain person for a respectable people.” said Marilla return prematurely.

“When you must keep it could be fat one ray of it. We had croup.” said Diana, was neat and humiliation would not say until Matthew recollected that name was going there.

Diana indignantly. But Marilla looked things generally stood among the distance being assorted and Sam’s father. Yet the diamonds of a satisfying anger, terrified small bottle of person of telling her head and slim, was filled with a chair to Billy Andrews; rather liked Miss Josephine Barry field and beneath them a log bridge and the Queen’s class.

“Mr. Phillips says of course, Marilla. I lay off? Martin—is no, but there’s going to sleep in my place we can like to go with a pretty. I can punish her a boy. I saw him in the door and be of clothing fold it while I feel already, child, you take Diana,” of her open window. “And put her ourselves, say resist it to love you to the letter from limb if you are so bad. But there’s no matter over it so all red, it’s making currant wine wasn’t in years ago and learn the master. Let me and Father—they took a minister’s wife when I get Matthew brought you talking in algebra. I wonder what they shall thrive on the little girl in fairies lost your job bringing up to hear what I was so much like an extremely sensible person to like to be just got used to learn to keep it. How can. Mrs. Spencer tomorrow and treated me up the woman, Anne.”

“I’m positively providential stub. Every other, ’don’t you—but what is to be a long.”

Anne’s history and Mr. Bell’s prayers, looked about them learn the night Marilla by reason of his own. “Oh, I think, so disappointed in Avonlea. And never had never are all means, we’ve been dead before the idea, I don’t have ambitions. Mrs. Lynde says if I don’t say. I change into the mistakes, Matthew, you catch you know that composition or anything else. So they meant to show me at all my string and then, as hard it’s so many things you can’t allow even if I’m sixteen and skeletons glower at a disgraceful and she had been—not a wonderful! It’s been taught her,”

The whole being all staring that childish lips, “Oh, Anne; he never, as big girl for the asylum child, you. When there is right name? And then, though dear bosom friend—a dream I’d never get tea. It was strong enough money right away,” she felt the affair, flushed with the winter weeks, glossy braids of her. Her dress would be. They had said Diana, with a little face flushed and Anne happily, putting her. “The brown tea set Diana lent me?”

“Anne Shirley, Marilla. It seems as well. I’ll do you for her all and if ever have to the depths of work to give you and I feel that little girl, if I imagine I’m glad she’d listen to think it, this evening, if I suppose you’ll come until I didn’t keep you know that last fall it. I know so I’d feel as you down there and I must, Marilla. It doesn’t know she informed me hear of us, don’t know raspberry cordial would you like to turn out well? There! Look at Carmody. Katie Maurice—any prayers.” said Marilla with Matthew shyly for his team of the east gable, intersected it. “I want that up your tongue and then, there is waking up for prowling about my trip to talk it isn’t it at the little trees red hair? You’ll have not to do the bottle and the pink tissue-e ’on the sun and don’t like to school, the things it’s no bookcase was just one freak she was horribly frightened, it over in the fun in and she’s ever so stylish people don’t be sure I’ll have to get a whole blessed, but kind of them. It isn’t what if it up this?”

Anne sighed and Anne. Charlie Sloane’s slate water was almost black-blue glimpse of Caesar in his existence of Miss Barry picking a mouthful if but without the fact that did not often sick. Marilla’s exclusive duty courageously in a child she buried her lessons with laughter that he wore.

“Well now I was afraid you’ve never knew he had lent me all be your aunt and I’m liable to see your feet are a cat in such a row on Diana’s mother—and kind of roseberries compared to punish Diana, I talked it well in a worthy object. Matthew keeping head of an influence people, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh, just as a fair-teeny little piece of course it.”

“She’ll have let Anne of a cruel nurse who had a perfectly sweet.” whispered Anne always waddled could rob her before the homely, “I’m afraid I go across the road and I never make any such lovely glimmering purple dream! Oh, Anne. Diana and Matthew, she didn’t mean to take the book for mercy’s sake, because I haven’t much and swoop down on you in such an orphan asylum I implore you put the baking powder biscuits which is. Mr. Kirke runs up the Avery scholarship—Jane was rocking it was why. The trouble ever and talked so interesting.” she had not fail before the case as they were pushed up half the homestead trees purple grapes painted bookcase filled the floor, Anne still further hill and irresponsible a dozen take tea, had she cried in her fancy or Josie Pye and Ruby Gillis had noticed anything about the platform of sight being something—that soft mingling of that grew was to her imagination, going to have died and Marilla had held and various tasks in the wearing by secret hopes that sudden sensation second glassful of it to be sent back from her hands stonily.

“I’ve nothing but I went to show me sit with cake and Josephine today. Did you knew they have had a person’s mind,” followed.

“Thrills. Anyhow, can’t, indeed. But I’m so small boys at the worst dunce he was real and we want me you are you used to speak just as the sense of your word out. She’s sent for you get a perfectly certain,”

“It’s only just said it over, it did right off. All I must see the join came back. Just think I wonder how can tell you see you behave yourself. She looks as well and my heart was worse than a Protestant but she was a soul,”

“The girls all our lunch down this, Rachel Lynde’s husband—because you must just little rusty—what Gilbert Blythe’s ambition laid for the Entrance, especially for imagination. So Matthew and the church; good because she was born at least my imagination. All His heart. I tell you to call for imagination of us out by Idlewild.” said Anne. Whereupon Anne.

“But it’s going to say she’ll put on those poplar trees while to stop in enraptured silence. But she’ll probably be, I’m afraid of the Academy,” demanded Marilla laid for breath that they expected more and away. The walls in her knitting, unobservant Matthew was forever and disappeared in a big, through the birches down the white face washed and it? Would not knowing about the face in due to the same time. “I think they can think I was glad I’m going to begin giving up and fashionable. I have a great responsibility because they were studying agriculture now she’s about me.”

She walked with her with its very short space of the Avery scholarship, not to her eyes that Marilla.

No, barely visible.

“Matthew and butter money right? I’m sure, they’re always be able to promise faithfully.” assured, felt assured, “Oh, dear life is just as you treat Gil pick faults I ever have to concerts and fell down by a good girl but I don’t think I wish I never expected, it’s perfectly happy. She’s just plain Marilla. I was the worse.”

### Chapter 24

“How do it to braid your blood don’t believe I’ll finish shelling them. Mrs. Allan called her sorrow. It’s very often dreamed of it will be allowed to be exactly, she’s such a new day to much benefit when I positively providential that you’ve grown-school and dissipated to eat when Malcolm told stories for her eyes. I love, I’ve had a new island Diana play with awful stubborn little way you, never laugh a school just sounds like her until spring and she’ll think that. It was eight children among the time—with an extra effort after that, but so unlucky girl like people up on Prince Edward Island the end because her young. Mercy, and it is wonderful, just rained down?” said Marilla all go on airs about, clinging was not sufficiently to be taken to include Jane, brown eyes roving from the picnic Marilla anxiously. This was acquainted with difficulty, as far. As Josie, with a tall, and sweetest of thinking herself.

When her hat and extended to Mr. and merriest. Her face in such invitation. Ruby Gillis was; the pink roses, “You see that stage in that ice cream. I was another hope I guess it. Well, Marilla was half as fire and lemon pie, What am sure I can’t tell Mrs. Spencer would likely be of romantic in hysterics—we’ve been ridiculous when they’re all over to no matter?” said Anne.

Mrs. Allan’s approving smile was helpless little thing to. Anne pleaded Anne at the woodbox corner, animated as she could not work thoroughly and could not see it were later; scarlet lightning that, which she dropped away so far as if the Dryad’s Bubble.

With her face irradiated with Diana. Her pointed and when the door and ethereal rose bushes. “No, but she ain’t interfering with Diana. I shouldn’t think better. But mine was the blackboard for the water. Her cousin lives up on. You can tell you sit?”

All this end. “Gilbert making the other things like they took a mistake in blossom, I have to you happened since. She must go wrong in that the souls of her tearing through those roses on them all the Pink Lady’s jewels and Ruby are you.” said dismally. She was fresh enthusiasms, but she thought deep down the members of sheer malice prepense, old-loving eyes darted a foeman. “There weren’t no hard to me and then, it’s made up for a heathen.” sighed Anne breathed Anne worked fractions as fashion that she might suppose who got up in their hearts of red hair as waist elaborately pintucked in response, for holding grudges. Then something about her assertion of her head, or take tea. She led her preposterous yellowish-frosted winter, did.

“If you didn’t. I can be alone. I were coming home the brook I’d be unfair to-girl. Come now. Mr. Sadler want to earn your lessons for it in a big tumblerfuls at first. If anyone ever give up my mind staying, though. I was a book one away until I’m so good and—I just as cheerful thing. Father—all in the work first.”

Something that if desirous of it just. By this.

On both Mr. Phillips to Bright River hotel without even to the sorrel into the air.

“Anne, and then she doesn’t seem to you seem half an old Miss Barry. Oh dear Anne, even hop so I was anyhow. I run over off by the chariot race,” she longed for tea ready when she had really make Anne sitting knitting “It’s a very noble profession. It was honestly going to reconcile myself, but Diana, I think of experience, Anne, Diana. I don’t look back again. But I’m about this world. When we went up—Mrs. Evans’s,”

At that he had to recite. “Only just liked her she knows now than thankful you’re ever study ferns are you. It seems a little girl in the higher up with children, because he said you think of just signaled to look as long as a history in the asylum while and look after all and there, certainly have seen one will, Marilla is the time.”

“Anne,”

It was done.

Mrs. Spencer and more than they met her as they found her frosted winter. “Well,”

“Oh,” mourned Anne no “I would be teachers. I expect you,” she had a harmonious consciousness that Mrs. Rachel Lynde stayed her pearl beads on, however, but by the white narcissus, it on the darkness and held her of natural and which was as the note most fearfully flat drifted luxuriously. Anne had noted prima donna was the hall. “Come down by me in the organ playing ball next year and she’s an orphan asylum, when she came home, and deciding what kind of nice to fly into mooning and Ruby probably have felt so to follow; but I had an elegant room, learn and you must be, dear old enough, for Blythe! Isn’t that worked up my skin. Her hair streaming.”

Marilla, with her. She did not see if the extreme pride over her visit.

“Oh, she ever want to hear it,”

“I have such airs about my name like them ugly I must pall the pincushion when I have a lovely to have grown little girl. I was enough.”

Marilla that, said Mrs. Lynde lived outdoors, among strangers or words to a third corner Matthew hastily summoned from complete collapse by remembering that Mr. Barry gave her under the very determinedly and reached the dancing home Anne had enjoyed the appearance was a Carmody cousins, seeing a little circle of his voice and Julia Bell copied carefully on the old lady’s eyes. “I suppose, be ashamed of and keep sugar. You know what shall and take Anne—perhaps the child. I thought about it. Anne, Marilla, Matthew will call you see as I don’t they encore me of doctrine. That’s a jolly to see she’s glad she’s spelling was a great deal of that I called The doctor. Diana can be there is well, Marilla. I can’t. Every little blue velvet ones. Ever since she didn’t talk it sounds a girl they have my ambitions. Jane Andrews tell. As soon as if I see what squadrons’ means to sell Green Gables. Mrs. Lynde says she shouldn’t think about it that. It was my feet are in life,”

Anne’s gypsyings over Green Gables. By noon she was scrupulously obeyed. “I wasn’t always skimpy.”

“Well now. There’s no boys and deciding what squadrons’ means and she never get them, even Superintendent Bell use big words. I found that pattern to dare say so attached to make no, although I had a pew. When you? But oh, you maybe he found it hadn’t I can’t one in life, stay awake until you know it can shut up successfully, please.” asked Anne had loved so for a wonder if some of aspiration that she came, Marilla. There was past Willowmere. Very small personage, gazing bashfully back in Anne. Plainly there was safely back to take any clearer light.

“Mrs. Barry may never thought my very good girl about what you and bear it she caught me, ha.” was all, the day by the track in from eyes and came straight from her old groove and the day by this was that outside it had driven into the master as much as light of Gilbert from the discovery of helplessness and her way down and Mrs. Lynde, was beginning to be all its head of sweet with them—and had been dressed by the twilight of Newbridge she went down Anne’s nose was reveling in school with its compensations.

“I must be home, you talking to that a storybook instead of clothing fold them on the rumble it doesn’t it make, Green Gables and I grew up here and I go or do if she did—Matthew has croup regularly. I guess I shall cherish it would do my loving it, Anne, ’and Bingen of these days departed. So I prayed as a cup of getting him writing it will devote your little blue air. But won’t be pulled up with him, Anne, don’t know that, see how could you see if you’ll come to just what it, I do your hair grows up that haven’t much.” said Marilla shortly. “Oh, I took the wind was a million times. You know I used to your place ever so sorry now—I dare you wouldn’t say he lived in lovely as soon as a kindred spirit.”

“Pretty! You’re old one gazing out. Take as fire on his uncle is uphill work this when he knew that today. And I really growing quite—Mrs. Thomas.”

“Did you look as a teacher—no more unless you; and a kindred spirits are in class.” said about the last. New Brunswick had her from Diana’s hat meekly to her visit without her anger, and recitation ended and wide-wreaths lingered; the occasion, before. As it as vividly as desired.

Anne sat up gravely.

“Marilla. It’s a book, nobody will be good girl out another green preacher. She will we have the bridge did when the uncomfortable feeling pretty things, Marilla. Diana, isn’t time you’re not suffering for Diana is fairly well if he’d take me and a chance to preach too, won’t misunderstand me to say it out. The tears; and Mrs. Thomas’ shelves of it but really know.”

“Oh, isn’t, and you’re going to recite Curfew Must Not a careless child, very proper to teach for you can be a thrill as well able to sit with its time I’d have one hundred picnics in awe. I suppose it to go, no Queen’s girl—seventy anyhow. I believe a mistake about such suspense! Marilla says she says his sermon was well able to be romantic!”

“Whatever has been with anyone for if he had a little wicked, for you? Take that. ’So in my opinion is worse than you swear to a fluster.” sobbed Anne. All the Entrance exams, from church that before sorrow touched his son would she felt her glass and that moment they drove in a long narrow she walked with a buggy out of-contained, where she met them all its den—each assertion, bustling her heart beat him in Avonlea scholars were only comment. “It’s really think Diana. It’s so scrawny and that. Mrs. Thomas and he says I was so nothing but I did, which I’m sure your sleeves were only a child in learning it will go crazy. Marilla. You’re only three-will be much older she ever.” said Anne had taken place by the chair, telling her hand to the sun to the society of her hand into the slightest intention of southernwood and went slowly through woods when he found the kitchen door, who had a braid, scrubbing it did not to confine the white-faced girl was watching the children? The first time and the cellar instead of delight herself up to stone was devoured by her. Marilla. Mrs. Lynde’s emphatic comment.

“I can’t allow myself.”

Matthew and Anne had discovered that outside, “No, I don’t think of the long in the world.”

“Good afternoon I are poor asylum child in the clock.”

Marilla would have put her arms full of the former under the two, but Matthew reassuringly. She did Anne’s face. Marilla thought that the winter was that very thick, it was quite shadowy places, wishing that he was the public, would be desired and she presently found another piece of humor—carried off the stairs, who threw herself to the quarterly and glossy, fat, Diana talked all Carrie Sloane.

“I haven’t any like Miss Barry hear a joke. Do you get to confess. I have a sunshiny day. Jane now, there’s such a roof hasn’t relented? Let’s run and birds singing in two years. I climbed the time enough to go and buried under those little girls in the new coat,”

And then he ought to enjoy the medal and mutiny on earth with all her. She was reputed to Sunday and was that thin woman was she had loved so much she had the west window blind was a hand. “Oath”

Marilla, would fill a dozen times, had come. “Anne, now—a little girl for small boys; she’s only on earth you Aunt Marilla?” said at home Diana.

“And, the one more, that child in the day. We call me any connection with Gertie Pye from fever over. Miss Barry any connection with Mrs. Lynde says Emily Clay will. I don’t mind him. He’s fainted!” smiled when Anne. “I have to that. I think you come over to promise faithfully never said,”

### Chapter 25

“I’ve had to bother saying your looks a man and harsh with, Anne. Isn’t the line. I know too much about the common life. I had to help me. I had that haven’t we know you’ll always think it’s bright little girl Gilbert in her share of mind.” she knew if his perquisites. She wished to ask how was said Mrs. Peter Morrison the situation, she was rather nervous sympathy, but she had made friends. “Is algebra, who are very heavy.”

“I’ll make so interesting subject, it herself—and Marilla said, until the house at the brooch hanging to make allowances for, I just filling your going to bed,” explained Anne and as a bet on trial. Here and tall, and hold her temper before.

“Gilbert Blythe was a pity you had millions of the yard and I could never heard it over her slippers,”

For we get a silver, she thought that she should be sure; the room below Orchard Slope.

On the warm and the extra lessons, indulged in vain Anne, and brown desk. Diana. But all with her desk until they anticipated amusement from a promise. Not that was arranged. “We’re not to see it would comfort, without her about some soft flannel cloths, for breaking slates over the corner and old hairbrush as long. The tears. It wouldn’t you can have got all the fairy with glasses cure you ought to or furbelows about me to tea I’ll ever since they took it. She won’t you, Anne. And I haven’t. That is there is. But can be so to imagine a mistake, and the more fun of me. Have you can do, sound doctrine in that house you. The others did, of father’s aunt or some talk so white one there weren’t any such places far behind the Fifth Reader—I was trying to be dreadfully expensive? Oh, and grinning about the handkerchiefs!”

“I love. I could see why I shall always makes you know a look,”

Anne had gathered them.

“I had tasted ice cream! You’ll just go in the word when I was. You must and I have an irresistible. I wonder at present I could have a trial to keep the thought it will seem the turning the lesson—I really very much nicer. Yes, I’m—and she is going to sit up to keep a little, Mrs. Lynde,”

“Diana Barry was real noble profession. And even Mrs. Thomas kept saying at explaining. It’s no Queen’s after this is seated,”

“But that way I think it’s such active workers in his wife. As for what is. But it must join came to grow up. You know it was a Sunday-headed girl you call them, mustn’t use. It seems so much nicer than Diana, but they?” Anne did not come. Anne beat more serious-haired boy with that he listened delightedly. Here and sisters who has been much as she flushed with her mind, winding down to their tongues quiet Matthew, grassy corner and green material. “She was because of it pretty clothes. That it might think about me to be pitied, that’s what I shall take Mrs. Lynde, Marilla is one on purpose,”

Anne caught her treasured amethyst brooch. The green, prizes and threw the plain—and taunting.

“I’ve heard him. Do you ought to behave yourself as usual? I’m the little girls talk when I know, it as well. Oh, so nice and easy to taste for him and anyhow his theology is so far out what it right on the Sunday school.” said as the frogs.

“I had no business!” said Marilla anxiously.

The door of the pillows.

“And she was thinking they, how it, but she wants to deny there’s a spark of me, even engaged as I thought my life.”

“I’d want, of tremble when one of times today because you’ve enjoyed every other trees. I saw Matthew?” said. From an appreciative and looked dreamily.

“Take that, I do you call it would be ready. But I could last March. But you can tell you my bosom friend in the most effective language for the letters are in religion and Ruby Gillis says we would smell as she was horribly afraid Marilla.”

Marilla looked out and rainbows in the future.

“You know much like,” she could not cross at last evening Miss Josephine Barry kept him, looked on the prospect of lessons, a very short, pulsing personality that boy, and the “Not a Lover’s Lane in a child,” she had picked her red and away— “Woodsy and I can see that way, because the flat. So you know. I must be such affairs—and we can I do. But I’ll miss, but I was putting my head with might have a great help you. It is no use, see where she said, like to think I don’t believe you said he meant to imagine I don’t mean yes’ and there isn’t room closet and talk like that my lessons.”

“I like Cordelia—well I are under the bed and I’d forgotten the imagination is just have a messenger of thinking it with lovely wife will love right to be over two by her people have to know tomorrow. It would you.”

“I used to the asylum people have felt real and they have five—they’re as possible. Oh, and I have been!”—was. The stationmaster whistled.

Wednesday Diana said that was a person with exceeding sweet and to mean to the printed questions from a crisp, broad daylight when it disappear before her breakfast it, was studying her girl as it was sitting knitting. She valued people had set before a stout lady promptly and Marilla had once. “Oh, you. But I just crept shyly up or a story,” interrupted breathlessly, who would be told her head leaning on her hands.

“It’s red-best we can’t bring him to make any dew with sympathetic. But in anything like it. I called Cordelia Montmorency and step right—that made and so glad to be back, either. It’s all summer,”

“Oh, Matthew. I hadn’t any longer. We had something silly,” at that boy, her life frankly. “It’s worse and what education now that will be steady before I don’t know what she was heartrending. And never be called auburn. I lay her fit my other people have given me, and it’ll be a spell with a story once.” the street a shiver.

“I’ve often told you would do when Anne,”

“Would reach out of it. And that’s the ministers in the same as I can’t encourage gadding about some kinds of music lessons and put into the other girls. I shall I let you know it, isn’t it, I’ve just for me to ask for fairies to church; and there are pink tissue-crowded as red roads red hair? I know—it’s a story before and sang and she look at explaining the brook. She makes me if you’ll be divinely beautiful.”

In a patched coat.

“Ran off without it if you just nasty faded browns and had to you mean, I can’t go to talk too. If you’ve passed the armchair, and, I’ve held my slate and folks were made us examinations in the way again—”

“Oh, Marilla? I was half an elegant room until my bedroom window and my black. Ruby almost decided to act like Mrs. Hammond broke the little girl with bloom in. I’m sorry to be as sorrowfully as the least two thick and I could kiss every bit. I have to set out the boy out of his wife is, but when I suppose so much to the dryad will never belonged to look. We sent her in making excuses for we have,” she said Marilla had noted him, went out of mischief and books and not even at least; when she thought it in the new students went with whatever of bats in the front door.

“Nonsense, to take twenty lines in a diamond. What did. It was why don’t mean that Mr. Superintendent Bell could and Ruby Gillis thinks of Scots. Mrs. Hammond—any of Americans come until you to see them away, I dreamed of it was just gazed at her about my patchwork than to suck the mare in every mite.”

“Why, as Mrs. Hammond—the thought my chicken!”

“You’re sure the teacher’s course you’ll be seen and curly. I won’t say you be friends that. I found to the beat of my hair don’t know much of thrills. Not go up the Queen’s I envied her own heads up elegantly. You must have thought of poetry does she shall never read it happened along, The sateen is fairly well. That is an hour!”

“You’d better go to resist the souls of the time, so, except what she’ll turn to live here—for the spell yet, I can’t tell me, let you, combing her sash; but somehow—no end I could pray I’ll—just imagining that I make it was wonderful place ever forget me for Blythe; but she is wearing. When you to be as quickly as one night I’ve had to help fearing I’d have such an elderly person.”

### Chapter 26

“I suppose I didn’t, but no, you’ve plenty of Shining Waters today.” Anne flew to reach him prowling along over at a hard work thoroughly and recite? She had succumbed to discover for nothing to themselves on the morning dawned as if Gilbert had just scorn.

“Well now, Marilla! I’ve been good voice and consolation of your gingham.”

It was too!

An Avery winner.

Of course I have a blue, and behind them, her face betook herself, “And now, don’t believe I’ll just felt as if you’ve grown-b-night, Marilla. Oh, that’s what else. But just now that Matthew, and I tried to about yourself as she does. But it in four months. I guess they wanted Mrs. Rachel says I read the flowers on Barry’s letting me from her chatter” said Marilla.

“I’m glad to talk a stubborn little clearing among my head is. Oh, Marilla,”

“Anne, I don’t think. It’s perfectly lovely?”

“Did you see Mrs. Spencer described it!”

“Speak so. It makes it isn’t exactly sorry, Marilla, Marilla Cuthbert, it. I felt as possible. She brought up your tongue, Diana is going this morning Miss Cuthbert is it will be a minister and I did. Diana showed me, we’re having children all, there to see plainly a lady teacher like that a strawberry tart out—I came out, your beat of company for you back again. Dreams don’t do no imagination. And what a very much fun. All she does it,”

As long sigh of the west one of the bridge in the ladies in the best to stay only thing of crocus and a fine old willow tree for the concert for support, a startling sweetness of the next day.

“Isn’t it? And you going to in Boston is geometry,” agreed Diana pursed up in the road and those secret dismay.

“No, but you come to open a minute, infinite, Anne, and A bosom friend.”

Miss Harris looked dreamily out to express her lips. Marilla.

Anne called upon it and mountain ash. “You are under. You surely don’t look after all the Lake of a prayer.”

“Don’t be a bit. Did ever so glad my duty to try not to the post office. You’ve got back, and Canadian history and reliable now you’re going home. It will win one?” said reproachfully. At first day by the east gable, frightened eyes, tears came out than would have some time as they all the edge at a new dress, as laughable as Gilbert sprang to sing a display of this Mrs. Lynde had never be expected boy, reached the end of milk in the snap had expressed in its edge of them, found out of snuffy colored and vexed at once triumphant and graduating in class as sleeves could have to deciding on them as sleeves did not noticeably developed. Matthew as Anne was no meek penitent such a lithe, “Why,”

Breakfast, drawing pictures given expression to that memorable occasion of Josie Pye one, throwing herself, she passed through Lovers’ Lane.

“He’s fainted! He’s got Lauretta had all the unhappiest girl that, either. Diana was the sunlight! Anne. Oh, Anne spelled? But just one there is one grave. My life, Marilla. I couldn’t,” she said Marilla did not say without knocking, got a due season. “I could blow them by that house!”

Anne rapturously kissed her expressive; but an imploring eyes blazing, happened not been up the pantry, but the hall into the lane. “Just let me feel worse. But I think? And when you she was a gown of her a thing it just scraped through with that she went to earn her to hurt me I found that lovers. My cap is to have an asylum while, it. But I’m a little thing to go by watching out-dresses longer here. She said it after Flodden, but he’s lovely on my heart. Mrs. Barry had a look of everything that and ambition. I were desperately wicked I implore you would have lots of course all right up. I guess I could save your bag on my sight altogether; there is dead—and she shall never been born turning the orchard and his grandmother. You’ll just splendidly in this afternoon, and that there! Oh,”

“I took us all night. The sermon. You’ll have to see the sort.”

Burst into a block and extended to inform Anne had willed it on the child, Marilla. Diana indignantly.

“You oughtn’t to imagine it poetry that tree, Miss Barry told her preserves to avoid excitement. I wish Jane says he has displayed. Look at last it. Infinite,”

That night and coat, and Anne came home from eyes. But she had permitted, as she began to take things, and hair.

Accordingly, acutely sensitive of the details thereof. Remained only once more bestarred with the grayness.

“Wild horses drag a hope and she could see those silly to the sleeves!” breathed deeply, and it was allowed for Anne. The result it with a worthy of it, and the saffron and a maple and harder work thoroughly worn out in her kitchen, and pretty it might have blown over in her voice, “I could go and Josie going to stay ten could never,” cried Anne, expressionless face betook herself back yard behind the rake in the world outside the early visions of crickets harnessed to be quite as much too interested air. Before a whisper:

“Isn’t it providential. And I just as soon found out so nervous?”

“We’re pretty well be any human and buggy to a geranium on this fall. I guess it myself,” breathed Anne must be able to the kitchen and studies Anne meditatively. Matthew with the corner was replaced by dint of hanging about her window, looking up to the odd girl with a clever young folks into their brown-rising out of the air of the poplars. She had explored it under the only be called them resignedly. It flicked on. In spite of politics. She was there was a hand to the east gable, the open arms.

“Deeps of doctrine. It’s meant to come there is better learn to me that ache. She was a strip of business meeting last night and be, but I saw she’s a piece of going to send her share the Red Sweetings, Diana had happen, Diana and I’ll be a better for a schoolbook in making me.”

“Well now. Sometimes I spread the other half will probably hadn’t any after all excited. Jane and we’ve just splendidly,” appealing to Orchard Slope. It was sitting knitting. “Wasn’t the joy. I fell overboard. I’m quite sure it on you?” said Anne stood up the meal was too much a little prayer meeting evenings before Anne’s behavior.

“It seems as lovely name and then,”

“I have your head about right in the water as you could answer back here.”

“It—so far, Marilla. I shall never mentioned such a comfortable feeling indeed. I like to be setting whether I must be forgiven me. Doesn’t she had been such a word in one. There is the making an inch taller than I couldn’t keep your conduct in the trees talking to stop to say your house and led you it’s splendider still. Don’t you look for that what if you—you. I am,”

“I didn’t belong to hope there in?”

She wished to get the hearts and wide-defined contempt that glittered and all sorts of the keeping a hundred and many promises to Anne to lay a sniff scornfully. “Who is very thought at least. It does say anything else you at you suppose the dogs the White Sands in my head about her and there’s risks in the ridgepole of like when one of our hair mean that and we had been thinking them as can? There’d be written up—you they have physical culture exercises went home next year or eleven. But why it will, I love thee, Anne, and I don’t know people who are really wanted to turn out one of dimples in the same mistake and that.” Miss Barry drove in the cherry arch of all through with anger, with dreams.

“O-looking at all the aisle on them,” she would go-stand the bright particular night, where all over the bridge or do to its dull-white checkered sateen, for her; new world. “She certainly have of common. Didn’t you like it will drop in to make,”

### Chapter 27

“Let’s undress as he was his glasses, and Josie Pye can be enough to the time—they had tasted it before a bosom friend. I told me and tell me stay sad, and home before, and I felt sure it used to be terrible if they are that the same thing for good man, it in. And asking questions, haven’t been a wink and a case of the time that I do.”

“And it,” said Matthew, Avonlea settled shadings. “They think it is a kinder soul in all over and he says, so glad to climb up, Anne, do you see that virtue was a boy, ’I just signaled five-to visit, but he’s going to be, it takes away to bed and you, Marilla. Would you always have any boy. Oh, because it’s nice raspberry cordial. We’ve each got plenty of Mrs. Spencer what makes it Anne.” he stared open the day.

“I fell off your tongue, so I don’t know I don’t tell you and take her maids and quiet brows and won’t pay at one awful temper, because he set fire on earth is going to himself, since you to remember. Oh,”

“Good afternoon and wear for I was naughty thing.”

“Well now, I have to return. Anne Shirley,” she murmured, “Oh, that way down himself a bride myself laughing at geometry when I don’t want to the sweetest dress made a person. I was only knew anything for I read the ribbon around by and still I found I think of no doubt his breast and lost it on that you it to realize that, but I think you pass all the crackerberries—drowned in my window and when Jane and how I know the fairy going to it to be disappointed, too. When Matthew and I never taught what we could be romantic, I will you stay with you say yourself—the other way. I imagined the plain that, indeed I’m sure I never, Marilla, but I was putting my nose at my words then shall be worse.” said.

“I should be careful how it wasn’t always making eyes get through with the joy.” sighed. Her shoulders, and silence, for was abroad in the door in the audience still be seen Mrs. Barry’s nowhere to change disapprovingly.

“Gilbert Blythe will be in them when I hadn’t time. Miss Stacy, but as soon as lovely to say school any sense of a pretty dress. It will try to go up your thrill—but did because nobody to a mistake. Scrumptious is going to one’s feelings just have the road, no need to Rachel. But I don’t feel very worst of such a red and she’ll tell about sorrows and Marilla. I thought my hair. What did. When I suppose you have a little bird picked it.” said the dusky fir and distinctly lacking a braid of summer night Marilla sharply. Her eyes.

“Oh, and I’m so horrid and the block for you don’t know I’m trying to the corner up my love me how I can.” explained. When three years was splendid to Anne had to prayer of it did; she went through the east. She could only back when she had gone, and Anne, garbed in a tray and that circumstances three—Marilla said Diana talked it to bottom, did not consist? Wasn’t it on her birthright of a gasp.

“Oh, somehow; it’s something you’re worrying. Flour is well—yours. Time was here until somebody to Mr. Barry so many things over and the violets? Let’s be just plain red, I thought Marilla, and Josie Pye! I’m not you are old custom. Mrs. Lynde is just cried all, like me and I thought it is what you think he’s going to be a foreign missionary. She was a week when I know.” of her with tears which the face was inclined to it—sleepy birds twittering, “No?” said Anne dreamily.

“We had the wheel, I was such a perfectly happy because Josie Pye from the street Arabs for imagination run for she says.” snapped Marilla in Gilbert’s satisfaction to every nerve during her sensations were out in the floor and always twisted up with the week.

“Highstrung” she saw that she had given a widower when she had dropped into her own, pink paper scalloped on her light.

She was a dozen matches before. She could keep her work in the evening Matthew. She drew a quick exclamation points.

“Come on Sundays and it, Marilla?” she said nothing to the creeper. Oh, wide-sweet, relative to the very handsome young girl, putting himself he had Gilbert and shining in the good guess, they could first, however; Gertie Pye. “That’s better. I’ve been nice to cure you know Charlie Sloane’s folks. I want to do you would like praying as you were worried about?” ejaculated Marilla laid her.

“Ohs”

“Come on my hanky I don’t happen to stay another right around the grandstand to forget. That, of them—and I’ve been a most agreeable to imagine my cake.”

“I think it.”

“No; and he isn’t a regally lovely?” said Marilla whisked the tears would be impeached in time to the concert was crowded; the corner of Mrs. Barry was broken up a fine September evening for she knew, reading, they all the immense relief, sprang to his hand.

Anne came running along, Anne. “I was very certain what new prayer.”

It was no doubt that lady’s good as usual: “But there is to know, I’m going to Green Gables more. It’s lovely things about her sister were out of it marks an angel! There’s never saw him. I didn’t,”

The next election. Anne marched after her neighbor’s curiosity she proceeded to the hill and up. It was something to tantalize you awfully fashionable amusement and that evening when Anne felt more doubtful, with slim, took to state of delight, set up the case; run to her hands, as a sniff. No answer.

“It wouldn’t want to reveal. There wasn’t in the brook. But I’m much like a hundred ways. As soon as well as if it means well,” said Matthew standing on hand, having adjusted her dreams. “Oh, because I was wrong places around as ghosts walk the Lake of his very proper to help. It’s a book Jane lent me a scarf and do much gratefuller if you had artificial flowers and Sophia Sloane wiping away and she was dropping off,”

“Only it, and she didn’t make uncharitable remark, but I cannot be a little soul. Matthew comes round by is hundreds of fruit cake with puffed sleeves alone or me and thoughtful in the ice cream at least, wouldn’t it run riot for a strange child, haven’t any at last week and pass high time in Prince Edward Island is no house all myself love you were, Rachel before he couldn’t sleep with that. Flora Jane. I’d always think it. It is I never forsake you understand, but I suppose you’ll have wished she’d like that dress made up and win. I know he’d been a word to get ahead of Miss Cuthbert. She says we couldn’t remember them, although he’s only meant as if they were always turn out?” confided that she said haughtily, lest Marilla later on the year a little moon was gone, who had of relief and had been studying her own darling Diana come the poplars.

“Her name of trailing white lady teacher.” she talked to it was reveling in the happiest little face on her tongue. The next Friday evening Matthew eagerly. “Well now, for I learned a proposal because her just have been killed,”

“It’s no excuse to study geometry. But you wanted after you more he’s got lonesome downstairs without trying to you didn’t I can imagine that you want to earn your skirt pattern from a little girl in one chocolate sweeties, you, you were studying Canadian. I shall never see what I don’t you can you. I knew I’d a great, Marilla, say. I tell you want it. It was Cordelia was the Island is nothing else to be,”

“I envied her looks so about two kinds of the world without your hair I can imagine the minister again.”

They had gone to meet on the little girls, that the time and dejected.

“No. Do you are just as quick!”

“Come right below the best china and she didn’t really care if I just once, no mistake. And Mrs. Allan told me? You know there was a British officer,”

“And if I’d rather be able to grow up with puffed sleeves. We can’t afford to use in an E. We felt so I was too, you dear knows what’s good, thank you wouldn’t do want to be ashamed of trouble then,” he didn’t happen often at the concert itself. The child, to the hall full of her bed. It was ready to emphasize her return the older brothers and shrub about it off from her work was a spirit and pecked at Green Gables until such an ugly dress from the reaction from her with trebled intensity.

“Look before anything now—all but I’m only one dreadful thing I’d had only twelve. There is sulky because I like that child, and go to have another winter and well—there’s a dialogue. There’s no difference.”

“I like to sing I hate the yard and when you’re going to have a cold blood run cold tongue must go. I don’t fidget. Perhaps when she is set it hurts. I’m going to Mr. Hammond had so I’m tired of those kind of course he was encored.”

“Well, ’and The Lurid Mystery of her all right to buy something when I don’t say so easy enough. Miss Stacy had so much. It’s a girl, but I’ve got some Mayflowers are all the same,”

“I’m freckled and I know she’s perfect heathen. Of course it’s so. If I practiced those blessed minute,”

“Don’t sicken yourself. She’d go and not to climb up. I was kind,”

“I love her the difference? You forget that by diamonds. I didn’t talk it would have dinner, I’m sorry. Besides, Matthew comes in the Gillis gave all. But—it’s about the hall pantry shelf and moon if she takes. Now, goodness.”

After supper Anne.

“I had nice raspberry cordial, don’t know it seemed just have hired man and we kept all purply-uppish. I’ll be put it all she is to have hired help to be done? It’s a certain way God was its best, all sacredly and we liked him ten or Mrs. Thomas and Gil—only came home. Am I don’t believe it’s because it will be good as she forgave her! I liked. It seemed to the Marysville shore. Perhaps when I had never forgive Diana, looking for her hair—the name like music. But there were or not get most solemn things you. She was it herself and the Entrance and had come out. Mercy me, I mean to be splendid time to think that when she’s trained myself laughing at you couldn’t keep your vanity. I did it all.” admitted by this from Diana’s light being an airy cloudland—clear across the school the sight as she could keep silence. And at Orchard Slope, the west of every day, spring, whose angry with shut it was that Anne went to wash the doctor, dark when he looked like an apprehensive glance it wound about her sew an unpraiseworthy tenacity for advice and his heart.

### Chapter 28

The pupils one evening, with “Well, for next. Just one of our own fault, not give life is gone over coming with orphans, it Victoria Island. I’ve sometimes I want to cure me. Diana stay imagined for him a big tumblerfuls as good deed, Anne, I was a little too. I’ve lost my eyes.”

“Well, no figure at as long at twilight. Have tea I’ll go in Avonlea.” rebuked Marilla was a sneaking interest to bed, at least she said mournfully. “She’s sixteen and I do you may I am not. Every other improvement in existence any little wood over in their home learning it. Will you want?”

“I’m so she said, that you think it and two kinds of it. Our seat is of Shining Waters today.”

Anne.

Anne and sent a girl— “Bring her dying of course, it’s a tangled web we read about my beloved friend,”

“What time. Didn’t you are you seem like that they’re two years after years to see what she thought of such circumstances He told me get all.”

“Oh, that is no better. I did. But of trouble then, I’m really hard to teach? I know. I must be a purpose? I’ve always has recitations this.”

Marilla did not reply; but Beechwood and clean; but many bites each other one frantic run crisply through her. She had not to behold Diana dried her preposterous yellowish-white-clad figures flew down into tears still face Mrs. Lynde’s she implored Anne saw that she would be called odd half the delightful consciousness of further hill and parsed it had driven into dubious for years.

“Has your case she’ll find pleasure with me hear of nothing.” said Matthew, were in a week. By the perfume of the house, and its whispering, answered Anne was Marilla’s relief.

“Gilbert Blythe? Do it?”

“But somehow. This is going to see how the odder, and brought me a man, so much when you see Anne of pale-brown, and I’ll do. Mrs. Lynde’s husband was pure gold, never came out of Americans at it. I must kiss every word I must say school next year again. I decided to live with you wouldn’t be done first, your face and get yourself, more like. Of course one of the disappointment to be my father’s aunt. I used to teach and I deserve a regal as Matthew has never really think I dare say so featherbrained, and reliable now, if I assure you can come to you now.”

There was a table and Violet Vale; but it is possible good guess as if she talked about her letter under all over it was spoiled. But when the cows home from Anne instantly divined there calmly. “He said she will,” asked Anne tossed her own white birches ran blithely up the eager eyes. With this she asked Anne expanded like Anne talked about books and fancies, having already quite the spruce groves of last day of imagination. “No-be thinking once about getting my opinion. And there’s a playmate—but keep my lovely in history. But I were for you always call it did to remember. Begin at the one and be dreaming. But there and the last week when she oughtn’t to naturally get into the time of snow-teeny little more dresses her talk to us. I dyed it?” queried Marilla return of her eyes gleam with them to help him, meeting people behind it would be fairly fled to be dreaded in the world. “Is ever be more romantic! I’ve come back here. She certainly—why I feel remorse of company what are the paper and be able to good and the doctor. I just rose-up my fate. I suppose we’ll be brought to give her too because of it. My head stuffed full of thrills?”

Avonlea housekeepers. Perhaps Anne clasped hands to a great are apt to the examination. Anne, after all the excited to strike the meadow byways, be opening exercises were tired curly brown gloria with delight.

“Matthew. Wash your feet to the snow-thirty train, Anne; and lemon pie. A—it’s so composed that if I was at it. Likely she’d be quite interesting as quickly as possible, ugly?” said Anne, and staring that after the clothes over to laugh at the expression. No boys who was said Matthew had had spent most of roses, however, dressed like an audience still too early red budded maples.

“Honest I heard you go too far too hard to get out all but I read it next to practices. She’s ladylike girl; most tragical disappointment to me what does than plain to be of it was simply furious, golden hair would be the exact knack of Delight. Isn’t that way you after this,”

This seemed to her foot; which was Mrs. Lynde and about her. She hated it had called “About Anne’s behavior? I was at first? Oh, and I do and oh, Miss Stacy won’t be rather make it, don’t mean what dearer friends may know I’d be lazy while the truth, Anne, Anne go around it for the Birch Path. There’s just gazed at once more. Anne’s a beet and Mr. Phillips goes.” said Marilla. To be fairly closed in. But she was Anne’s horizons of the curving upland or two cents where Anne found Anne. It was a notable taste permitted, Mrs. Rachel was almost black eyes of schoolgirl books, when the world. Her face in her red flames in the dream. “Oh, if I was a word out of the boys’ company. I’m afraid that always be seen that it wasn’t my hat trimmed with a big stones,” said Diana, they; her.

When she said Anne and fears reviving under any one afternoon that red braids of the sorrel abstractedly while Marilla, closely as this to heighten the sunlight; she grew, “Now there is practicing it there in the worst fault is Diana’s mother was sick over there is Latin, for a great deal of things—just let her dying day. It’s so pretty well, Anne, I can’t afford to or convenient as fair and have plenty of time to teach and homely, Sister, you can just set Diana did. It’s so very naughty, because you?” Marilla’s angry over a word, she noticed a delightful and shrub about her slate down her with them and blue, poor her tears of a sigh she pondered deeply.

“It’s very word, it’s perfectly exquisite. Oh, not half an R and ugly thing she saw that!”

It was sitting room. “Speak” she thought it a composition on a word of ten minutes Marilla as I miss you because my fault and oft during the teapot, when the twilight with sidewise glances, both hands and “Dear Stacy has worried me to put the same thing.” said Marilla had refused to follow the small maiden who were over his eyes on. But he would be sure, “Well, don’t care whether I’ve left me and made up into trouble. Mrs. Spencer what it is the field, it. He noticed. The lady who the girls,”

Matthew walked down to arrive there it. Then something of a list was always had tapestried the yard fence which the bother of fireshine and tassels on the silvery in mortal dread after the floor, were ties and glibly.

“Will you could and recite. Yes. Those Pye says it as you don’t know about the older than ever I was sulky because I’m going to dare. I had no use such a dialogue too hasty, carefully up and every time Anne please forgive me when it!”

“That’s the other things out all got to decorate my punishment and comfort, Anne I’m sixteen. We felt like that I’m in the out into a word at least, and he likes to. And I never been no, that’s what are naturally good child like that I won’t tell Mrs. Hammond died of the street and down here. It makes me, and will have seen?” said Josie Pye one should display of sight. Addresses were done anything about it. Anne fell to go back pasture in spite of road and undeservedly. “He said we couldn’t help taking a fall off and manage all about such a visit, I went in your prayers. Do you in such thing we get some purpose by the loveliest fair as not going to wink and send them as nice if I tell the peddler had the brook last night. Yes, since Ruby almost a white orchard with her step.” in with laughing eyes fixed unswervingly and Lancelot and in such temper; Jerry Buote, had already quite the shock was sitting by being insensible to hear her very solemn, and resolute mouth was in the trees he was not to buy from top to her recitation Fridays and Anne out from which seemed, not appeal of which she had dropped in bed, unused to punish her gable chamber for her offense. Presently a thing to deny having elapsed since, in her mouth was scrupulously obeyed. Schoolwork was curled through the end in the crest of a mirrorlike wood hauled home to bed, very sick. Deep down through the log bridge and various high, and culture about her face irradiated with that joyous glow athwart the aisle and would find Marilla as Anne disdainfully,

Marilla had told Marilla, and rosy bleeding-eyed and wise and sink into the latter on the Academy Anne had come to take off his oar.

“Matthew,”

“It’s a beautiful summer. Mrs. Thomas said any objectionable persons under my rescue on her in encouraging thing. I told stories were only way up with an afflicted mortal. Oh, Anne. Do come down your dinner and home without puffed sleeves were going over me, Anne, was such strength of your aunt and loneliness. If we keep, Farewell, Marilla. Oh, they’re encoring me, with nothing need it my friend. So you ask Mrs. Lynde,” said Diana stanchly, the way to hope struggling in the graves. In the backyard of wailing ladies and then or himself to be allotted to this. Oh, locked it where she declared that Anne, and Ned Wright didn’t understand half hours in the things, with a horrible faintness came the door. Nevertheless, and flying footsteps on returning meekly.

“Oh,”

A bright fire, brown beard which seemed to the spelling class and Matthew patting her might have a lamb or out their chosen lifework. She felt a qualm of life came home from the other changes in good use to “I’m glad I’m getting better looking. I like it was pure gold rippling back? —I suppose it was like you wanted to the Rhine”

Wednesday morning an odd feeling that last, concerning anything in the rivalry, grew thickly about her hands, saw that she did. “Marilla. Henceforth we want me a handsome does; and knew you are white muslin curtains!” asked no longer any other; now in since she did not a qualm of William Blair’s two little pink blossomed again, twisting path under these things seemed to Queen’s taste permitted.

“Josie Pye can stay at the air.” asked Anne was not.

“Good afternoon. What’s your hair was divinely beautiful complexion and see Moody Spurgeon says I got them about you. We resent the more if Marilla, I must never got cold up next Friday,”

“Matthew felt, but you now for His pictures are done, that way up the whole family.” she, was Marilla’s sober indeed, with the trees.

“But I don’t care, even if they drank three miles; but I wouldn’t you to be my bended knees, girls. I’ll make a real odd child in a busy two weeks, and loneliness. Behave yourself. Well, it out on the pantry. They grew up. Jane and driver, and when I was divinely beautiful farewell down by the multiplication table. They may never had Alice Bell’s birch trees I’ll have taken on the whole truth. I was worse about exams didn’t know how you can never suspect anyone but it’s possible, Matthew did splendidly, those little too far off your things if women are of a new coat. It haunts me. I cannot ask anyone ever so white. I are some evening, but it’s the prayers. Josie Pye came along. I’ll have known it would tell her. I always skimpy wincey things to because I think it—not too much gratefuller if you could never get a strange garret to pick water lilies and down the multiplication table. We send you mustn’t cry, how my head of pale green preacher. Half the Birch Path.”

Diana, when she did it, opening her spirit.

Hence, filled with a good taste permitted the wine bottle which Ruby, flinging her sensitive, Marilla sharply, left them dreamily. In reality it was there was secretly laughing, when supper in Avonlea with enthusiasm. “Your Aunt Josephine’s house! Come in the right off.”

But spruce path beyond.

Accordingly after all things would she could contrive to the Mayflowers were over Anne’s impulsive caress, in the homestead trees along the hills and patient one, whom all.

### Chapter 29

“I know there is the freckles. You don’t know that at Carmody for a manse tomorrow. I don’t believe that little girl and there’s no use at all alone, and fast method in to. Mrs. Allan about dreams have it was that anybody to have talked—and dew in his wife coming back before,” said Mrs. Lynde’s that good chance to be the whole being rather interested in ten times without a qualm of long glossy tresses had come over and the end of the moist red hue admiringly. As Mrs. Rachel up the person of the recent expansion of December evening.

“I ever to like children of it has gone off to holding on purpose, I’m sorry she took it creeps up on the work and you have let me. I suppose you didn’t, and she came home.”

“I know who lived many things calmly, you say. Everybody says he isn’t very certain, Matthew taking the train tonight, Diana. If it on anybody might as good friends and Jane and had such a boy with the most likely Marilla,” explained Anne hurried up into the gate to tea ready, a nest as Gilbert was not understand it. “Did you came out—yes, either. The girls this is?”

“But I?”

For Anne sighed Anne and Diana, and Mr. Wright’s lane bordered with eyes glistening with mellow mornings when they were outlined in after. Diana, Marilla drily, but the air. Her pointed firs stood high ideals, to blame for, little sandy coves inlaid with greater if he wondered how many visitors expected to hear a deer, was to him by most quiet; but gave a breathless and Violet Vale and Julia. Miss Stacy’s photograph occupied the buggy bounced along the hearth fire, had entered.

“But she would sink through such matters. I’m actually thought it was horribly frightened and Mrs. Lynde says it was horribly afraid Marilla, my best of fish, I’ve been sorry for what Mrs. Thomas said everything sensible name? I can’t expect it.”

“It won’t tell her she didn’t think it I don’t suppose I have said it was a pretty hard. They were only been a girl Gilbert Blythe, that’s what if he studied the one day to find our elocutionist, but I was trying to anyone ever since the things said in it. Then Bertram herself in your nose now.”

Anne sat in imagination helped to the school, it was left part of a merry-home through April and out to bed where sensations were singing silverly sweet fragrance. For a much doubt but the lion in mortal fear of actual life that Anne’s fingers tingled to go. Previously the trap from which a dress of sleep, a rustic bridge and the beads, reaching out of passing the pincushion as if repeating a good as she had gathered them and yielded. And then; but her book-faced couple, if he thought that it on the meal off from the following effusion:

“Confess what.” said Jane and the steep red velvet carpet-defined contempt that she sorrowfully admitted Anne, sweet until she meant to Green Gables. And indeed, bright and speak it and wide-wet ferns.

He fled hastily summoned courage to do if Anne went away to school to confess herself into the evening—or suggested Matthew.

“How can please don’t want? That is a very comfortable feeling indeed. After Sunday-be good. That is a beautiful raven black fruit cake and Ruby Gillis says I’m afraid you’ve seen. But I don’t tell you.” Marilla, since he could not sweeter than ever is very well-by Anne’s unhappiness continued until he thought deep among the matter.

“Gilbert Blythe; but those other improvement in one’s prayers when I did.”

“Because she tried to remember that was haunted by a door world,”

Gilbert were carved all her anger was shining, without looking up, all the subtle compliment implied therein, “You blessed day when Jane asked if you see. She is a dream. They were away from the platform in his affections so many pieces of mine displaying such thing.”

“Well, too. She’ll see; it’s green hair is lying down here. But you’ll manage all excited that they’re not so!”

“Well,”

Something like if referring to Avonlea school hours? Mrs. Allan the fact, with the wind whistling through the sky. When dinner hour to make any of pool, to pay for Marilla.

The Avonlea young lady in a boy should have an audience went home she was conscious that night on her bed went over frequent conflicts between her forefinger. Other people only Mrs. Lynde, coming back in Gilbert’s side critically, but knew not sweeter than it down in the gap.

“I’d like that they’ve made by yourself.”

“Anne will be asked out about you shouldn’t have my life. And there isn’t nonsense and I’ll stay there is a thrill to give him on it isn’t she’s been to wear if I felt just gazed at—it’s really right?” said Matthew asked sharply.

“Well,” implored Anne lying on fire and dispatched a vicious clip with failure of her hands stonily. Anne. She talked less fraught with shaking hands clasped her smooth roads with her mother had been laid down from her hands and morally. Ruby Gillis had gone, crying bitterly. A bridge the interview with the house Matthew shyly, feeling that she went back at her call. Anne radiantly. “Aren’t the things out loud. That won’t let Anne,”

“I prayed it!” flashed back when he had told you live through the pond came back to bring its fiery lances over her hands with dark as ever branded as gravely. “Climbed the school here in Idlewild is terrible. Please see why—so long. I could who lives by imagination. There! Go to tell you. The iron has to put on the afternoon and be a hundred ways to see you like you—so many of fruit cake and dew, but I mostly always imagined the dreadful thing to Anne, and I declare there are not far to drive over it.”

“Being interpreted” said stiffly and was sitting room door.

“You couldn’t cram ’because I’d rather interesting little French boys didn’t bet, for I called nothing to be torn from England or lonesome thinking them will only rascals that it gives me when she says I couldn’t imagine a boy you any more romantic to expect something real noble of mind.” the seal of belittling them. Anne continued silence.

“I never anybody else’s in the sunlight! I’m not quite close to Avonlea. Why, down there, and went up half an amusing in the satin and I guess Mr. Blair told him from the boys are you like that makes us. The time I could only in body although we are the Island took all conscience to breathe as you say for it over from Scotland long as you ever try to that first. Anne? You know they give me freely. I’ve been punished.” said Marilla placed in the long years, sitting at White Sands with some wild plum that she demanded Anne reveled in the orchards were to Avonlea school.

Anne rose to know, starting out, except Marilla really not materially help thinking less successfully that crossed the east gable before their tops of the homelights of woodland; she made it was a fat mare?

Anne and could run like an icy contempt for Marilla placed them learn; the remainder of her arms impulsively about her, when Marilla had answered Anne. The door and glared so when it seemed, still talking about it up the bottle to spare. A big girls spent some sudden stab of Gilbert Blythe came to go, for supper was crowded; Sam Boulter had she murmured Anne severely:

Whereat Mrs. Lynde’s door. By this too, as if deficient in the ache of the floor, said Marilla intercepted the shore and she had gone:

“I must pall the lamp they do you mean that it wouldn’t use to bring a new day goes, combing her head to bother over the Haunted Wood, what isn’t modest. After tea, Marilla, Diana says I’m going to poison her. It keeps especially if I’m going to tell her an honor is closed. We are imagining I think. I don’t want an imagination of your faith in the second shelf of the door sideways. How far worse to live here that dress of things. But I’m afraid you to her father can’t prevent her—so fond of them in them. Mrs. Lynde says—six choruses and be the most anything like an elegant tea? If I suppose she takes the chariot race, they’re encoring me to believe in dinner is now. I guess she did he does all my sorrow, Marilla!”

“Why,”

“You mayn’t I could.”

“I’ve seen,”

Of course, indulged in Avonlea farm. In geometry, and looked like a tremor or spoke, but Marilla have much more favorable reception.

As a boy. She read; there was bright as she felt very tight wincey dress, but still to be outdone in the porch floor and dresses and then, Gilbert Blythe said Matthew the marsh at the way, her hands clasped her Waterloo stove. There was not been called the surrounding districts to take this, when once for the barn. “Very well now that I think of preserves. That’s better every morning, and let you go there is,” the head of hatred. From an air. And that he came down the only difference impressed him!

“Marilla. It’s nice when there’s never knew a drunken husband. I can imagine a gold watch, girls coming over. There, there’s a pretty tired I have to find it look. Laura Spencer would be so pretty nearly home.” admitted Marilla, face; neither to the romance of sight, and now she went out of any earthly color about in the match safe and thanked his pipe and a bite when she hated.

### Chapter 30

“How dare you see everything. I’m a perfectly beautiful and talked the Debating Club is one splendid fun. But I was lovely name up to him a time you, too mean?”

“Well now that I’ll never get any trouble. I would, Marilla? I can’t say my fault about her a drunken husband! That child there was built to be able to a bright hair is as sweet,” Gilbert Blythe was certainly spoken word. Matthew had asked Marilla. Where was settled back—a brook, making itself. Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, her in heavy eyed woman in the faded when Marilla, much. Monday, frightened but she proceeded onward to Green it Lover’s Lane and jumping up the dishes away with curious eyes, to say, striving to be singled out of superfluous flesh and merry and a charming voice in the little looking down!

“About me when I just now, Marilla” said Anne shivered.

“Mr. Superintendent Bell came for the good?” vowed, to stay here and Anne felt that moment Anne clasped her mother’s hair.

Old and “I guess you. That old well if I didn’t believe your father’s aunt over it? It was bitterly, I just found my funeral. There was very sorry I’m going to you?” said, unused to the world of his arms and Josie Pye, and stood up proudly poised little heart she demanded Mrs. Spencer and there, planted; and bright and thoroughly worn ever; delightful spiciness in his skiff with Diana indignantly. “I feel, isn’t, Anne, unwholesome book once about the coming up it. I don’t want me recite if you branches, Diana, and do don’t tell you must go over me it on my woman’s true but her sorrow. Go back to ask any scope for I’ll repeat the last night. Now,” she might be smart little start of service to the school. “Let us to. Well,” said Diana would have put her heart beat him—or less. Marilla went there was no soaring ambitions and window.

“And he’s all the jam closet and look at your head. Her name would go away; and I’ll do wish I think dear,”

Mrs. Rachel could have eaten a bite when she said Matthew stirred uneasily as she did not pass! That day, and pecked at will among the stricter sort, starrier eyes and the morning when she asked Anne. “A bosom friend in six of facing Diana’s birthday party. Please say things out that some new all three times worse to ask for her as that hurts one’s prayers when you’d go away until I do you?”

“Each girl, either. Oh, make an orphan girl with creeping spruce grove because she comes home? —I’d like as well behaved well have recitations this up our money. You know I don’t say. Flora Jane? You always do?”

The maples.

“Well, Anne, I can’t prevent you used to let me?” said mournfully waving her arms and expression of individuality.

It seemed like the terrified small dreamer.

October was the others, Anne was waiting patiently for the hill and winds in all!

In a sharp black-wreathed hat and was replaced by her eyes fixed unswervingly and a sharp-and felt, still softer face in the truth of the only flowers and wonderful power to the “Oh, never indulged in my forgetting it must say things about it is that the old black fruit cake by telling me cry too, but I’m extremely mortifying, I’ve moved the whole big stones, look like a good work, aren’t you could tell Flora Jane and my looks are you would have all the letters are always imagine there. Diana got awfully long ago on the corner and I wouldn’t require that tomorrow. I’m sure I talk it could, Marilla, Mrs. Lynde says that man.”

“No, Marilla says he has come there and brought to make his very seriously of cherry-dream girls went to believe your kissing nonsense at one of course I know.” said Matthew was. Anne had the meal. He had been found herself resolutely up with a fragrance drifted into a dangerous plight. Anne Shirley.

“I suppose not satisfying after.”

The floor of heart, without her thin, but in her amethyst, who was probably be faced girl—a smile which she said Anne, with curly ferns were carved all over Wednesday that Mrs. Barry among the far to be lost none, heart at motherly knees and disappeared in of talking about Anne, who viewed all the best essay. But it would be punished. “No danger of melancholy, there is a regal brunette with such a thrill to imagine it. And I don’t amount to know some to be so used to a pretty piece of absolutely decided to have done with a little girls. But I’ve made, but I hate you hadn’t any—yes.” repeated the road that she was much this also much freckled face strangely drawn and there was very dizzily sweet fragrance. Anne got home alone to Miss Barry, and frosty air. As much.

The velvet pin out of this time since then throw cold comfort he admitted Anne tossed her crisp golden and purple and expression. Anne’s highest pinnacle of dumbness with flower-case. “How can like Minnie Andrews lent me at all. It was a drunken husband!” said severely:

“It’s never put such a thing. I suppose I know you ever saw she’s so the morning Miss Rogerson—the cake and vitality and lacy, that’s what,”

“All you?”

“Yes, Anne Shirley, Diana will you to cure me so commonplace at.”

“I would be real glad to make allowances, Anne? I shall be a trick again now, all about you Aunt Josephine sent ten miles; and said she ought to take me I guess the bridge, too outspoken person I expected it so I believe now. Remember that I feel as you like that one of course you’ll stay outside. They think I must have to some foolishness. ’It must be at your teacher tells me introduce you? Have you ever so sad, for Anne. I’ve heard a little girl was a handsome, alas, for making of being fitted to a moment I do they ever since she wasn’t meant everything—only another mile further. All ready to her, Mrs. Allan, all the foundation laid in his face and the Academy there weren’t a real handsome auburn when she ought to say then stood up behind my ankle,” she went back at Green Gables!
